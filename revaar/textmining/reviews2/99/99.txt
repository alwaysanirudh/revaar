"I've had the computer for a little less than a week, but am very pleased with it. (See below for how to fix the scroll bar problem if you encounter it.)"
"Great laptop for such a low price.  I was looking at an older model of the same laptop and Amazon let me know there was a newer version available so I thought I would check it out.  Newer processor, more hard drive and an extra 2 mb of RAM for just $12 more, how could I refuse.  No one else came close to this price.  Shipped the same day I ordered and received it 2 days later.  Why would you go anywhere else?"
"i brought this laptop as soon it was annouced online, this is a very good price for such amazing features, windows 8 once u get used to it is also great and fun to use too, the only problem is the battery life, it is said to be 4 hours, but it seems not to last more than 3 hours at max.is it normal like this and can i find an extended 9-cell battery for this dude?"
"I GOT IT FOR $529 , 1 TB AMD 10 PROCESOR AND RADEON GRAPHICS  FOR 529!! BANG FOR THE BACK PLS BUY THIS ONE YOU WILL NEVER REGRET IT. SUPERFAST EVERYTHING IS FAST GRAPHICS WISE INTERNET . I LOVE IT."
I was surprised that there were no reviews on this laptop. Like ANYWHERE! I saw the specs and the price and I knew I wanted it. I called so many stores trying to ask about it and it was never in stock or they had no idea what model I was looking for. I even had to call Toshiba to make sure this was real lol.
"This is a nice-looking laptop - very light and more powerful than my needs. The display is great when I use it - usually I have the docking station connected to my large monitor/mouse/keyboard. The track pad is a little tricky at times, but the performance is amazing. The hard drive has enough space that I'm sure I'll never come close to filling it up. I couldn't be happier with my laptop choice!!"
