El teléfono no cumple con las especificaciones técnicas que describen. No posee Network Band 3G 900. La telefonía que utilizó solo levanta 3G por esa banda.

Necesito saber si hay alguna forma de activar esta banda (3G 900)??

según el equipo viene con 8GB mintieron solo tiene 4GB y el cargador vino malo no funciona. Por estar tan lejos en Venezuela y el flete sale caro no lo devuelvo. Que es lo que provoca.

1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous "stupid" phone, March 15, 2013

My experience with this product has been a nightmare, from the beginning, without it having ever being dropped, exposed to water, anything. True, some of them are just the curse - yes, CURSE - of touchscreen (baby)technology, which is still quite lame compared to real buttons. And no, these are not "malfunctions," they are design flaws, period - I saw these same issues on other minis.
The following are the anti-features you can expect:
- a touch screen that often does not respond at the speed demanded - this creates a HUGE risk during driving, when a user has to avert his/her eyes to try, try, try, try, try to answer and activate the speaker (and end the call), especially as the screen repeatedly blacks out (for what? to save the pathetic battery power?) and canNOT be quickly revived. This is particularly fun when answering calls from clients, who do not expect to wait as this little piece of crap decides if and when its owner can answer it, or when dealing with automated systems that don't understand why it takes so long to press the directed key.
- the telephone shuts itself off without being touched, and even with a full battery
- the telephone cuts off the internet connection on a regular basis, without being touched, without a change in location, even in the middle of an online function during what a second ago had been an active connection. This did not happen to me with my previous telephones.
- press on the SMS button, frequently get the camera - repeatedly - until the mail decides to wake up
- try to send an SMS, and it tells you it failed even when it didn't, or that it was sent even when it failed; wait 4 days to get an important SMS
- try to send an SMS, and it hides the "create new mail" function for a few hours
- receive an SMS, and occasionally have to guess who sent it, while being thankful that at least it was designed to display the name/number of the sender
- press on the missed calls function, get the last person YOU called
- search for a number in your phone, Russian roulette if it comes up
- and of course, the battery drains very, very, very quickly when you use it for internet access
If you need your telephone to really function, try another company. Any suggestion that a more expensive phone is necessary is criminal, as the above issues have to do with very basic functions that should be expected at what is already quite a high price, given that the assemblers make less than minimum wage.

I bought two of this phone (new). One of the phone I received was a open box with the seal violated/broken.
The second surprise inside of the bag where the phones were has a power adapter for the outlet (european to us). Both phones were european (I believe the written is german) and the adapter they sent was for the phone charger since european outlet is different from us.
Very disappointed, I returned both phones
Be careful when you buy a unlocked phone and check the seller

The Samsung Galaxy S3 is a horribly made phone. After the second week of owning this phone the screen shattered after falling on my carpet matt floor. A couple months later the phone would not hold a charge more than and hour. I had to buy a new charger because the one that came with the phone stopped working. Last week the phone stopped charging completely. After reading many reviews about the phone needing the charging port replaced by THOUSANDS of different owners of this phone I contacted customer service. Since the screen shattered they would not replace the charging port even though it is obviously a manufacturing error. This company is horrible a phone purchased at $500 they will not even repair. Horrible product cheaply made horrible customer service not willing to admit fault with their own product even though it is well documented all over the internet. Not to mention all the bugs the phone has.
