1.0 out of 5 stars Overheats, freezes, & horrible battery life., September 19, 2012

This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
I dropped Sprint and switched to Boost Mobile, going from an HTC EVO 4G to the new Kyocera Hydro. Next time, I think I'll shoot myself. The phone overheats, freezes, and even running Task Killer will go through half the battery in less than four hours without even using the phone! The camera is atrocious, the screen resolution is poor, and the charger port cover is flimsy and tedious to get open. The phone doesn't have speed dial numbers, but shortcuts instead.

Boost offers NO warranty on the phone. Bringing it back three days after I bought it I was told I should have added the five dollars a month insurance (with a $65.00 deductible on a $130.00 POS phone)!

I may save some money with Boost, but I won't be doing it with this phone.

1.0 out of 5 stars Kyocera, Fix Your Phone!, February 6, 2013
By

This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
For being a cheap phone it has some great features. UNFORTUNATELY the Kyocera BUGS OUT all the time! Almost without fail, calls that go beyond 5 minutes (or sometimes less) will end with your caller going "Hello? Still there?", unable to hear you. IF you act fast enough, switching it to speakerphone will make you audible again, but often times it's too late and they've hung up. Shucks. Looks like you have to wait on hold AGAIN! Woh woh!

IF Kyocera fixes that, I will change my rating to a 5, but hopefully not another person buys this or any other Kyocera phone until that happens. Half-a$$ed BS like this should not be legal, let alone rewarded.

1.0 out of 5 stars Had it for almost 2 months, February 22, 2013

This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
Switched to a smartphone about 2 months ago. First tried the Samsung Transform Ultra, then decided on the Kyocera Hydro for the lower price and Ice Cream Sandwich OS. Oops, Kyocera forgot to put in a proximity sensor on this phone. When you are talking on the phone the buttons get pressed causing muting, speakerphone, 3-way calling, ending your call. Extraordinarily ANNOYING!!! After contacting Kyocera (I did receive a prompt reply via email) tried adjusting the "safety" (weird nomenclature for this setting) and it's still way too sensitive to use as a phone. Everything else on the phone was fine, UNTIL yesterday. Now the on/off button is failing making the phone unusable (I've since read this seems to be somewhat common). It's really too bad, if it weren't for these two issues I'd think this phone was ok and now that I have everything set up the way I want it I have to start over. I may be done with purchasing this type of item from Amazon, too. Good for everything, EXCEPT making calls, if it lasts! I didn't test the waterproofness - but really manufactuere's should make all phones waterproof like this one as it looks like a simple silicone gasket is what seals the phone.

Also, does not scan barcodes, only QR codes.

Save your $ and headaches. Buyer beware. This phone does not work properly after a few weeks. It freezes up. It shuts down randomly. It fails to open apps. Check the phone's reviews on Boost Mobile website. You'll see a long list of people who are experiencing the same thing. Thank you, Amazon, for letting me return this faulty defective phone after three months. BTW, the problems started within a few weeks but over time have gotten progressively worse. I can hardly get my phone to work properly anymore. Requires pulling out the battery to reset.

DO NOT BUY!

I have had this phone for a couple of weeks now and I must say this phone sucks! It freezes up on me DAILY. I have to take the battery out and reboot the phone everyday. The apps take forever to load. The speech option rarely works and when it does work its never accurate. The navigation app locks my phone up every time I use it. I got this phone on Amazon (brand new) for $50 and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

1.0 out of 5 stars Yet another crazy 1 star rant, March 9, 2013

Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)
This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
I spend more time plugging this useless thing into a charger after finding it dead than I do making calls. If I spend time choosing the icons I want on the screen and my own wallpaper, then the pointless BoostZone software will replace my icons and wallpaper. There is no apparent way to disable this nonsense. I would list several more annoyances, but it's not helping my blood pressure.

I now understand why 1 star reviews often appear to be written by crazy folks. They've been driven that way by terrible products. This crazy person has thrown this "smart phone" across the room - not once, but several times since he owned it, and has finally decided to use it for a science project that involves a hacksaw.

In summary, I can't recommend buying it however cheap it appears.

Phone was garbage. Had it for one day. I had to charge it 4x. I took it off the charger at 6pm and left the phone alone woke up at 5am it was turned off. Turned it bk on battery completely dead. Plastic battery cover please feels like a phone for a kid especially if u need a bulky water proof phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars I love this phone/computer, November 21, 2012

This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Summary: Other than the newly announced Samsung Galaxy S4 and LG Optimus G Pro, it is the best phone out there. It would be better with a bigger/replaceable battery and SD Card option and MHL 2.0, but for 50 bucks. What a deal.

-

Likes:

Size: In short, it is NOT too big to put up to your face or to keep on your belt 100% of the time or to use one handed. It really does feel like a phone and not a phablet. Compared to my old Thunderbolt, the DNA is thinner, about the same width and about 1/2 inch longer. It weighs exactly the same as my Thunderbolt after you remove the battery and back cover.

Appearance: It is a very nice looking phone. No one who has held it has thought it was too big or too heavy or cheap or boring or whatever. It feels good in your hand.

Speed: There is remarkably little hesitation in responding to my requests. Apps downloaded and installed much faster than my HTC Thunderbolt. Emails with graphics load astonishingly fast. Four core is the way to go. I quickly get frustrated with the speed of my old phone now. The phone is not any slower, my expectations are now that much higher.

Phone quality: It has the best speaker and microphone for making phone calls of any phone I have owned yet. Better than using my $100 bluetooth headset (which was not true of my previous phone)

MHL: They do not mention MHL and I suspect part of the reason is that they use the old MHL 1.0 not the newer MHL 2.0, and as a result, a 1080 screen has issues.
Also, since it is the 5pin not 11pin configuration that Samsung is now using, you cannot use MHL and OTG at the same time.
This MHL adaptor works: BoxWave HTC Rezound HDMI Adapter - MHL Adapter for the HTC Rezound, Stream Content From Your HTC Rezound Straight to Any HDMI Source Such as an HDTV! I put my review of it there. It works just fine without power, but with my 2amp charger, it WILL charge the DNA while streaming FHD HDMI out, tho if you leave it in overnight, it always locked up my phone. I was unable to get it to work with any HDMI->DVI adaptor I had, tho one of the HDMI->VGA adapter I tried sorta worked (it topped out at 720)
The MHL to VGA adaptor from Monoprice also works so that I can view the output on every monitor I have, however I cannot get a full 1080p display (even tho the adaptor says it supports 1920x1080 and HDCP). It too will charge the phone.
The 1080 display on the DNA begs to be used for streaming HD video to the big screen (hotel room, visiting family, bedroom, etc), but so far, I have only been able to get 1080p out of it on one TV set. On monitors I have only been able to get 720p which for me is more than frustrating... it takes away the single biggest reason I wanted a 1920x1080 screen on my phone.

Screen: Watching FHD video on this screen is captivating. It is stunningly clear. With a FHD display, it begs to be used as a computer. You can browse the web EXACTLY like you would at your desktop and still find the resulting tiny, tiny text quite readable. <Update: I am now at my mom's and I normally would try to get to her computer to use the internet and for the first time, I am quite happy just using my DNA. In fact I am now typing this on my bluetooth keyboard looking at my DNA screen. I am using this phone for a much higher percentage of my web browsing than I ever was before. When I used the built in screen to RemoteDesktop, I was very glad I did not go with a 720 display.>

WebBrowser: I have always preferred the HTC web browser due to its text reflow when pinch-zooming. However, they have added a new feature that I am liking a lot. Add To - Reading List, which saves that web page for later viewing (even if you do not have any connection) and the links still work (if you do have a connection). They have also added this Labs - Quick Controls which I am liking a lot. It remains full screen, and to reach your options, you slide your finger in from the edge of the screen.

Camera: I like the camera very much. It takes low light photos very quickly and with good quality. Much faster than the Thunderbolt... my wife will LOVE that when out and about with the kids. I am loving it for taking quick snapshots of something I am reading and want to be able to refer to later while on the train (with the Thunderbolt, this was very difficult to do). I am also liking the ability to rotate and crop my photos within the camera.

>4GB files: I had no problem uploading via the USB cable a 7GB WTV file to the internal memory and playing it with MX Player.

USB Host Mode OTG (OnTheGo): Using this adaptor T & S Electronics Micro USB OTG Cable - Google Nexus 7, Xoom, Samsung Galaxy, Iconia A510, Toshiba Excite 305, & more. LIFETIME WARRANTY! you can do all sorts of stuff with that USB port. The one big downside is that there is no way to charge the phone when the USB port is in Host mode. This is a BIG disadvantage to going this route... but I did already have all the equipment to test this out, so I will leave it in the review. It does NOT provide enough power to properly run my 3.5" external USB drive, tho my USB Flash Memory Key works fine.

USB Keyboard: I was able to use a standard USB keyboard and even my small usb wireless keyboard with built in trackpad: Logitech Wireless Touch Keyboard K400 with Built-In Multi-Touch Touchpad (920-003070). I like this combination.

USB Speakers: Using the OTG adaptor, I was able to power my speakers via the speaker's USB power supply cord and (using a 1/8 plug M-M cord) get fabulous and loud sound: Logitech USB Laptop Speaker Z305. I do not need to lug a notebook computer around (or sacrifice it) to play movies for the kids (via NetFlix/Hulu/Amazon/WTV files from my HTPC/video files) or background music when away from home (via Pandora/mp3 files/etc).

USB Key / Flash Drive: I reformatted my Flash Drive to FAT32 (Neither NTFS nor exFAT natively work on this phone -- I tried) and had no problem playing any of the Win7 FHD WTV TV shows I had copied to it. HOWEVER, FAT32 is limited to files of less than 4GB. Fortunately I discovered Nexus Media Importer by HomeySoft. With it I was able to restore NTFS to my USB stick and with MX Player associated with Video files in Setup-AppAssociations, I had no problem playing my 9GB WTV files from within Nexus Media Importer.

USB Hub: I was also able to plug it into my USB 3.0 powered HUB and view both the keyboard and flash drive and power the speakers and power my 3.5" external USB hard drive all at the same time. It would not charge the Droid at the same time. Since the devices are drawing their power from the Hub and not the phone, it should help lessen the drain on the DNA's battery.

Wireless Charging: Any QI charging pad should work, but they seem a bit hard to come by just yet. Since it is smaller than the phone, I had my eye on this one Nokia DT-900 Wireless Charging Plate - Retail Packaging - Black), but I got impatient and picked up a Verizon branded one and it works great. It looks identical to and carries the same WCP-700 designation as this Amazon listing LG WCP-700 Portable Power Mat Home and Office Charging Pad. It is larger than the DNA, but with my corporate discount it was only $42 and it was available today.
Beeping: THe WCP700 beeps when you place it on the pad in the correct orientation and it beeps repeatedly at some point after it is fully charged. Three times now I have been awakened by this beeping. See the comments for instructions on how I removed the speaker.

Fastboot: Under the battery section, there is a checkbox for fastboot just like my Thunderbolt. It makes the PowerOff work like hybernation, so if I turn it off at night and back on the next morning and it boots up in about 7 seconds (12 if you count the 5 seconds you need to hold down the button)... if I need to clean out cobwebs, I need to choose re-start. However, I have found that it uses so little battery power when all the radios are off and the screen is off, that maybe this is no longer really needed.

Notification light: Easy to miss, there is a barely noticable round led light to the left of the camera lens. My case covered it up so I drilled a hole for it. I have never yet just left my phone lying on the table upside down in front of me, but it makes sense that to minimize distractions during a meeting that a phone on silent upside down with a small blinking led notification light would be helpful.

DLNA / wireless HDMI out: I finally received and tested the HTC Media Link HD H200 (99H10801-00) for One X, One S, One V, Droid Incredible 4G LTE, EVO 4G LTE in Retail Packaging. My review of that is there, however in short, it worked well for video and apps. For FHD Remote Desktop use and games, you definately notice the 1 second delay. I returned it because MHL is working so much better (however, the H200 WILL work via HTML->DVI).

Sound Quality: I have watched a couple of movies now and listened to Pandora a bit and I have no complaints about the sound quality via headphones or external speakers and I am rather picky about that sort of thing, so that is a strong plus. From my point of view, no phone, no notebook computer, no tv set has adequate speakers, so I will not comment on this phone's speaker other than it is adequate for speakerphone use.

The new Recent Apps button: The OpenApp button in the lower right corner is nearly identical in usage as how the HP Touchpad works. Swipe sideways to see the running apps and swipe up to close them. Nice.

ScreenShot: Power+Home. Very nice.

<The 2/19/2013 update fixed this issue: Angry Birds Star Wars will not play. Other apps may not play?>

-

Dislikes:

MicroSD slot: This is big negative for me. I thought that I'd be okay with USB Hub option, but since I have no way of keeping the phone's battery from draining using that method, a 64GB SD Card would be a GREAT option. That said, if you do not plan on putting hours and hours of music or FHD video on this device, 16GB should be plenty. I have researched/tested many wireless storage options and rejected them all but one: Seagate Wireless Plus 1 TB Mobile Device Storage with Built-In Wi-Fi Streaming (STCK1000100)

12GB of available memory: Since it has no MicroSD slot and you cannot charge it while in USB Host mode, the 12GB memory limitation winds up being a problem if you want to upload any large video files (upload 1 file, view it, delete it, repeat). After all my apps have taken up their space, there is not enough room left over to upload any large video file.

No Drive Letter: I am about to refresh my backup of my phone and none of my normal tools for comparing the contents of two folders works because no traditional means of referring to folders understands what Computer\HTC6435LVW\Internal storage means. With previous phones with SD cards, I was able to do.

Wireless Charging: The Qi charger does not work if you have a USB Host Mode OTG (or the MHL) cable plugged into it, which is a shame because that is the primary reason I purchased it.

Micro USB Cover: It may help in keeping out water and dirt, however it is one extra step every time I want to plug something in. 4 months later, I have gotten used to it and it is still there. It helped that I caved in and bought a wireless Qi charger. I have also recently seen a tear down of this phone and there is a rubber gasket going all the way around the outer edge. Between the gasket and the usb cover, it should be more water resistant than most phones.

Micro HDMI port: I am disappointed that there is no micro HDMI port to allow me to use the OTG cable at the same time as an HDMI cable. MHL has issues that a dedicated port may have not had.

FM Radio App: It did not come with the FM Radio app which has been preinstalled on every HTC phone I have every owned before now (this being my 4th or 5th). I use this app every morning as my wife's favorite radio station blocks all avenues I have tried to stream to my phone via the internet, except of course for it's own Android App, of which I am not fond. My old HTC Thunderbolt has become my full-time bed-side radio alarm clock.

Removable Battery: I am worried about the non-user-replaceable battery. I always had a spare for the Thunderbolt with me at all times and have used it many times. So far, after 4 months usage and lots of testing... I have never been below 20% battery life left. Soldering it in there enables them to use a smaller battery and case and therefore make the phone noticably smaller and thinner and lighter. I have a lot more MicroUSB chargers these days, so there should be a charger most every where i go, but I still expect that at some point, I am going to be left with a dead phone. But is that really the end of the world... no, not really.

Menu button: I know it is the new standard according to Google, however its absence means that the 3 dot menu bar pops up on every application that is not programming to deal with it (most annoying so: LogMeInIgnitionForAndroid).

-

General:

Keyboard: There is an option to "swipe" your words. As a long fan of Swype I was intrigued, but after 1 day trial, I gave it the boot and install the Swype "beta".

NFC: Samsung really sells this with it touch-to-S-Beam videos, however you can do this with the any phone with Android 4.1+ which has NFC built it like the DNA. It all depends on how the app uses it, which is where Samsung has really run with it... HTC not as much, but there are 3rd party apps. I have not tried it yet.

Holster: I dropped by the Verizon store on day 1 and they had in stock a very slick belt holster (Verizon branded) for it that looks good, allows the wireless charging to still work, has a nifty option to display the phone at an angle to watch a movie or use a keyboard and view it like a monitor. OEM HTC DROID DNA Shell Combo w/Holster & Kickstand HTC6435

Screen Protector: I am a bit annoyed that no one yet sells a better screen protector precut for this phone. My current phone is going without one... I am hopeing the Gorilla Glass 2 lives up to its reputation.

Bloatware: Verizon has forced upon us a suprising limited number of auto-start-up garbage apps (compared to the Thunderbolt 2 years ago).

HTC. My last 4 phones have been HTC. As annoying as some of my phones have been at times, they had their good qualities and no phone is perfect.

Unlimited Data Plan: I was worried about loosing my unlimited LTE plan, but in reality, I never used more than 4GB per month and the 4GB/mo plan with tethering ($50) is cheaper than my old unlimited plan with tethering ($30+$30). Yes, I paid for tethering.

Battery Life: So far, I have used it daily for over 4 months and I have yet to have a dead phone. So far so good.
With all the radios on and no effort to conserve battery power, using a bluetooth headset for half of my phone calls:
-Phone 1: 12 hours no travel 48% - 14 hours and 300 miles of driving 37% - 14 hours and 300 miles of driving 27% -
-Phone 2: 14 hours 66% - 19 hours 50%. - 16 hours 47%
-With MobileData Off unless needed and Bluetooth and Wifi on 100% of the time: 14 hours 73%, 21 hours 49%
-With Bluetooth and MobileData off and WiFi on: 16 hours 83%. 11 hours 78%.
-With Bluetooth and MobileData and WiFi all OFF and turning them on only as needed with less than 1 hour of screen time per day: 12 hours 94%, 36 hours 76%
-With Bluetooth ON 100% of the time and MobileData OFF and WiFi OFF - turning them on only as needed with less than 1 hour of screen time per day: 42 hours 75%, 52 hours 60% (worth noteing... I keep my bluetooth headset OFF until my phone rings as it connects quickly enough I do not need to waste battery power)
-With a lot of screen time and a terrible LTE signal in my office (when I accidentally leave it on all day), I find that after 12 hours, I am generally down to about 20% battery life left.
-In short, I keep my MobileData and WiFi off until needed in order to buy me more screen time. There is no need to burn battery time to hunt for a signal when I do not need a connection.
-I have started using the Tasker to automatically turn on the WiFi when I am within 2km of home and turn off the WiFi radio when I leave and to turn on the LTE radio when I turn on the Display and off again when I turn off the Display, so it is much like leaving both on 24/7 and yet I seldom have less than 70% battery life left at the end of the day with normal usage (1 or 2 brief phone calls, 15 min of web browsing, 30 min of Kindle reading on the train, a few texts, checking the time).
-After 4 months I have yet to have a dead battery (tho I have seen it warn me to plug it in a few times, I was always able to plug it in and use it plugged in).

Bluetooth Keyboard and Mouse: I was able to pair it up and us each just fine, but the mouse was way too erratic, so it is tucked away in a drawer forever (the Logitech Tablet Mouse for Android 3.1+).

Speed: I am amazed how much faster Google maps locates my current location (super fast GPS lock) and how quickly it shows traffic conditions. My Thunderbolt took about 1 full second (vs instantly now) for the location and it frequently took FOREVER to display current traffic (vs instantly now). This alone will save me a LOT of frustration if this continues.

Reset: If the DNA becomes completely unresponsive and you cannot perform a restart, then simply hold down the power button for at least 10 seconds.

Wired Ethernet: I had hoped this might work, but it did not: [BobjGear USB to RJ45 Compact Fast Ethernet Adapter made for Android]

Thin-Client Remote Desktop: I have moved this into the comments. I doubt many people are trying to achieve what I am trying to achieve with a phone.

HTC Media Link HD H300?: I tried three times to order the H200 on HTC's website, but it was cancelled on me each time and they finally told me the reason... the computers say it is discontinued. Perhaps there is a H300 coming out soon? No one knew anything.

Google Play: I had no problem signing into my HTC Thunderbolt's existing Google Play account (putting 2 phones on the same account)

Exchange: I encountered no issues with connecting to my company's Exchange Server during the initial walk thru. I had previously been using Touchdown for Exchange, but I thought I'd give Google's email handler a try and so far, after 4 months now, I am still liking it, tho I did have to consolidate my calendars into one.

Crashing: My first phone would crash or reboot whenever I used a FHD app for more than 8 minutes. My 1st replacement phone did not have this problem, however I do occasionally have apps mysterious shutting down that seems to be related to lack of resources for certain FHD requests (FHD Angry Birds Star Wars?). I am guessing that this might go away if they increased the RAM. I thought my 2nd phone was rebooting on its own, but it turns out that the default sound for new google mail was the same sound as the reboot sound and since I so seldom get gmail, it took a long time for me to make that connection, but once I did, I just changed the sound for "Default notification".

Rooting: I researched rooting mostly to enable NTFS, however I came across a post by someone who notice that the phone keeps track that you rooted it, so even when he unrooted it, the notification was readily available to any Verizon rep who would decide to deny the warranty because it had been rooted. True or not, I decided against it, just in case.

It came with a 1 amp charger that looks just like the one that came with my Thunderbolt. I frequently charge it with the 2 amp charger that came with my HP Touchpad.

It is running Android 4.1.1 and HTC Sense 4. It has 2B of internal memory with not quite 12GB of alternate-pseudo-SDCard memory available for me to use.

Bluetooth displays as 4.0

I like Android 4.1.1 very much. I forsee me installing far fewer utility applications (folders, task killer, etc).

Contract Expiration Date: I have discovered that I am eligible for a new discounted phone on 07/21/14... 20 not 24 months.

Both phones I received (1 directly from VerizonWireless 11/21/2012 and later in the store 11/26/2012) came pre-charged.

Update: Verizon did release an updated operating system last night, however it is still 4.1.1 and HTC Sense 4+. "This update includes improvements for WiFi connectivity, Bluetooth connectivity, and other things such as improved audio quality over wired headsets and earpieces." Also repaired: Angry Birds Star Wars now plays just fine.

If you have any specific questions, just leave me a comment.

5.0 out of 5 stars No better smartphone out there right now, November 20, 2012
By 
Trooper Thorn (Maine, USA) - See all my reviews
This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
CAMERA

The camera on this device is fantastic--if you're used to the HTC One X you'll know a lot of the features, but coming from the Rezound it's a massive improvement. It's still 8MP, but HTC's new sensors are amazing. The low-light photos are a huge improvement over my Rezound, and the S3 as well. You can take snapshots midway through recording video, and the continuous shooting mode works exceptionally well, offering a "best shot" option to automatically delete all the other pictures in the series if you only like one of them. The panorama feature works exceptionally well, and I wowed an iPhone carrying friend with its ease and quality.

DISPLAY

Simply put, the DROID DNA's display is absolutely stunning. At five inches, 1080p and 440 pixels per inch, you'll be hard pressed to find anything that even begins to come close to this. Watching videos or looking at photos on your favorite photography site/app is an absolute treat.
The Auto Brightness setting works absolutely flawlessly, adjusting to the level of ambient lighting before the display is even turned on. This is a stark contrast from my Galaxy S3, which is often too dim, and frequently changes it's brightness long after I've turned the screen on and began using the device.

BUILD QUALITY/DESIGN

The device feels exceptional. The material covering the back is slightly grippy, which adds a feeling of security when you hold the device in your hand. The Galaxy S3's smooth finish is almost too slippery, and makes the device feel delicate and prone to dropping, though I am quite a fan of its curved shape. There isn't a creak or groan to be found anywhere around the device, which is something I've become accustomed to with HTC devices in general.

EASE OF USE

The DROID DNA runs Android 4.1 Jelly Bean with HTC's Sense 4+ UI. What this means is it's EXCEPTIONALLY EASY to use. Everything is where it should be, and everything works the way you expect it to, which makes for an enjoyable experience.

The DNA retains the three primary softkeys (that have become the standard since ICS) instead of on-screen buttons, though unlike the Samsung Galaxy S3, the Menu button is not included. That is somewhat annoying, as apps' inclusion of the on-screen Menu button is inconsistent, and navigating to the phone's setting menu requires a swipe of the top pulldown. This is pretty nit-picky, but it's my only gripe about the ease of using the device.

BATTERY LIFE

I struggled when trying to decide whether to select "Good" or "Excellent" under Battery Life in the Product Rating above. At 2020 mAh, the battery seems a bit lacking for a 5" 1080p monster like the DROID DNA. Initially I was worried about its performance, but I've found it to be pretty respectable. I'm getting pretty close to what I had with my Galaxy S3, and for a quad core 5" 1080p monster like this, I think that's pretty excellent.

PERFORMANCE/CALL QUALITY

Upon opening the Navigation app, the GPS locks on instantaneously. This is a huge advantage over my Galaxy S3, which often takes literally minutes to acquire GPS signal and begin directing me on the road. Again, I'm used to good radios/GPS from HTC, my Rezound and Incredible were both flawless in this department as well.

In tough service areas (like basements or large buildings), the DNA outperformed my S3 every time. I held 3G signal in my gym (in a university basement) where the S3 dropped to 1x consistently.
The DROID DNA's signal is excellent, and it's call quality is as well. Callers sounded crisp and clear on my end of the phone, and they reported good quality sound on their end as well.

Overall, this device is simply magnificent. I was shocked when I first held it, and even more shocked when I slid it easily into my pocket. It felt fantastic, far better than my Rezound, and about the same as my Galaxy S3. If you buy any device in the next six months, it ought to be the HTC DROID DNA.

(REAL NAME)   
This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Rather than covering things that professionals can cover better, I'm going to treat this review as a user supplemental to the likes of Slashgear, Engadget, Gizmodo, etc.

Battery - let's get this one out of the way. The battery is fine. My previous device was a Galaxy Nexus on Verizon 4G LTE with the 2100mah battery. The DNA easily matches - if not beats - it. I don't foresee any problems getting through my average day with the built-in battery. The sleekness and solidity more than make up for the fear of not being able to swap the battery. I use the wireless charging and may buy a second for the office - just in case.

Physical - The flap over the micro-USB is a must for me. With wireless charging it makes no sense to leave a port exposed. Good job, HTC. The power button at the top is probably the worst part of the phone. It is a real stretch to get to it. I have regular hands and find one-handing it to be easy. However, the center of gravity is a little higher up in the phone than I would have guessed. Be careful to learn the grips before juggling it out of your pocket in a rush to answer a call.

Sense - Going from a Google-Nexus to a carrier edition is actually okay. Sense looks nice and performs great. HTC has a track-record of being speedy with updates. Also, Google have done a brilliant thing by updating individual apps via the Play store. I'm happy with the trade-off. Not a big deal. The bloatware is tolerable. Again, Google have made a great decision in ICS+, allowing users to disable annoying apps.

Storage - 16Gb isn't a compromise in the cloud era. With WiFi everywhere and 4G everywhere else, more content is easy to get. True, I cannot hold the entire LOTR movie trilogy in HD on my phone at once - but, I think that's okay for 99.9% of users.

Screen - Simply amazing. The reviewers who say that it is not a big upgrade are selling the phone short. Both the resolution and the technology are great. However, for those who are very picky - like I am - there are a few notes. As with all LCD, there are a few spots where the backlight is visible at extreme angles. And, I had the dreaded dead pixel. Verizon was happy enough to swap it out - twice. 2/3 phone with a dead pixel isn't great...

Audio - I'm an adult man who does not play hip-hop or pop Katie Perry or whatever. I play what may would call oldies. And, with Beats, it sounds really great. Both the speakerphone and the earbuds (using urBeats), are loud and clear. I highly approve. I mostly listen to Audible books and they sound really good on this setup.

Overall - I am really happy with my purchase and think it is a huge upgrade over the Galaxy Nexus. Were I able to get the Nexus 4 on Verizon, I'd have to think twice, though. And, those wondering about the Note II. Just Don't II. I tried it and it is just too big and the pen is just too much of a gimmick.

5.0 out of 5 stars Amazing, December 11, 2012

This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Have had the Droid DNA since launch day, and this phone is the absolute best.

The battery exceeds my expectations, getting through a full day is no problem for me using web, email, text, google talk, streaming music via BT, checking weather, reading Kindle, you name it. Average 12 hours or so battery for me with 20% or so remaining at the time I plug it in at night.

This phone takes full advantage of the Verizon network unlike the Verizon Samsung GNEX and S3 I just got rid of. Samsung has very poor RF performance compared to this HTC. I now have rock solid LTE where the Sammy's would constantly be searching for a signal, and often requiring a reboot to reconnect.

The Verizon bloatware - Disable it. go to settings, apps, click the app and press DISABLE. Bam, gone!

Google now - a huge battery drain, disable it. If you need traffic or calendar reminders open the appropriate app. Google now is constantly reading calendar, gps, using data, who knows what else. Disable it and enjoy a 25% or so battery boost.

The screen! The screen is gorgeous and very fluid. The only app I have found a problem using the screen is the built in web browser. There is some minor vertical tearing, where one half of the screen will update faster than the other when scrolling. No biggie as video and flash works great. Fun fact - this screen is about the size of an iPhone 4, the whole phone!

I love this phone, get it. Rip off the stupid rubber charging port cover, and get the Diztronic case as it fits perfect and matches the phone color and texture perfectly.

5.0 out of 5 stars Love this phone, November 25, 2012

Sierra "Sierra" (New York, NY, USA) - See all my reviews
This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
The droid that made me want to get back from the "dark side" (owned 3 iPhones before). Was hoping that iPhone 5 would inspire me, but alas, the screen was too small, the phone felt the same as the ones I had before, in general, I was bored with iPhone and iOS. HTC Droid DNA worked best for me. Obviously it has amazing screen, great camera, and sound system. Love customizing the phone - changing launchers, themes etc. Storage was not an issue for me, as the cloud takes care of it more and more, and 16Gb is more than enough for my music/videos because I like to rotate it often.

My main concerns were phone size (too big), battery (non removable), and learning a phone system other than iOS that I used before. After half a week of using this phone I'm happy to report none of them are relevant. The phone is very comfortable to hold, most of the time I can use it with one hand - and I do have much smaller hands than, say, my husband. The battery life is comparable to my iPhone, and as for Android OS, there was no learning curve, it's very intuitive and surprisingly user friendly. No glitches, random restarts - things that supposedly plague Android OS, - extremely stable, fast system.

Apps variety - after downloading all kinds of apps on my iPhones throughout the years, I came to realize that I'm actually using a handful of them on a daily basis, and all of them (and more) were available for my HTC Droid DNA.

The switch was much easier than I thought, I am very happy with this phone, can't name anything that I dislike about it. Apple still makes a great phone, but if you are bored with it, definitely consider HTC Droid DNA.

*** Update from husband and an Android user ***

HTC DNA is the best overall Android phone out right now in my opinion, certainly on Verizon. Samsung Galaxy S3 comes the closest in terms of competition, but has issues with reception (based on users' consensus) on VZW which results in sub-par battery life. The screen on S3 is also not as good as the screen on the DNA. HTC DNA, however, has very strong reception (able to keep 4G and connection in general even in weak signal areas) and remarkable battery life despite industry-leading specs. And it puts those specs to good use too: the phone is a pleasure to use. It's dependable, smooth, fast and very stable. The camera is excellent as well.

Quick note: it is important, in my opinion, to promptly disable all the bloat, especially apps produced by Verizon. Those Verizon apps tend to run automatically, are typically poorly written, almost always useless, and tend to cause problems, such as unnecessary battery drain.

Although overall HTC DNA is, in my opinion, the best phone out now, it does not best the competition in each and every area. Here are a few areas that, if important to you, may lead you to pick a different device (in the order of importance):

1. Storage space. The DNA only comes with 16gb of storage (11gb usable). This is low by Android standards. My old HTC Thunderbolt, for example, had over 40gb. This meant I could not move all my music to the DNA when I upgraded. This issue is not easy to remedy. You may have to either stream your media or get external storage. Streaming uses your data plan, battery, and is not always available. External storage (connected through WiFi) is somewhat cumbersome to use right now and requires carrying an additional device. Many competing phones offer more storage, notably Galaxy S3.

2. Battery life. The battery life is very good. It is the same or better than the major competitors, such as the iPhone and Galaxy S3. However, there are phones out there (Razr Maxx and Samsung Note 2) with huge batteries that can last much longer on one charge. If you require a huge battery on a daily basis, the DNA may not be for you. You can, however, get an external battery with the DNA if you need large battery capacity only occasionally. Unlike external storage, external batteries are actually cheap, convenient, and easy to use.

3. Screen. The screen on the DNA is extremely sharp and currently offers the highest resolution of all mobile phones (at least as far as I know.) This high resolution, however, breaks some games, including the popular Angry Birds Star Wars. Most games work fine, however. Developers may update their games to work with this high resolution, but some will never get updated, and others will take time. If playing certain games is important to you, you may have to pick a different phone.

5.0 out of 5 stars A Masterpiece, January 16, 2013
By 
Patrick Smith - See all my reviews
This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Got this phone for Christmas and boy am I impressed! My father is a career Verizon Wireless employee and works at the national head quarters in Basking Ridge, NJ. I have always been introduced to the latest and greatest in phone technology and I test them all thoroughly. I am unbiased in that I review all phones and choose simply the best. I own apple products and android products. Both have exceptional software (especially for smart phones) and user interfaces.

Here are some things I was looking for when shopping for a new phone:

1. It needed to be FUTURE PROOF! I can not stress this enough. Meaning, most people are stuck with their new phones for two years. This means that it is imperative to get the best technology so that in two years, your phone is still churning and keeping up with the best. The Droid DNA has set the benchmark with this. It is the first phone to produce true 1080p screen quality. For those of you that are considering the iPhone 5 because of its "Retina Display", it only churns out about 720p (a little less, in fact). "Retina" is just a made up tech-term by apple (one of the things that is starting to turn me off about apple, but we'll get to more of that later). This is a big deal for me because I take a lot of photos and videos with my phone. It is nice to be able to look at my photos with this gorgeous display. It blows all competition out of the water in this respect. I won't bore you with more technical specs, because you can easily look those up on the internet. I have the DNA and my brother has the iPhone 5, side-by-side, the DNA's screen is a sight to behold. Also, this is by far the fastest phone on the market. Download speeds are incredible and it wont slow you down for a minute.

2. It needed to look good. Yes, this matters. Nowadays, people look at each others phones and pass prejudgements based on their phone. If someone sees me using this baby, they immediately think, "Damn, where can I get me one of those." I am not just saying this to be funny. Just yesterday, I got a haircut and my barber saw my phone and asked me all about it. Wanted to know what it was, how i liked it, was it too big for my pocket, where to get one. Needless to say, he was enamored with the physical appearance of this phone. The slim design and red accents on the side make the DNA a very attractive device, one of the coolest looking phones I've ever seen. This phone is not just for tech-savvy nerds. Women will easily appreciate the sleek look of this phone, it's truly beautiful; not to mention the intuitive interface and easily customizable home screens- Which brings me to my next point.

3. Usability. Phones these days are getting very complicated and tough to get going out of the box. This phone fixed that problem by making it easy to use out of the box and customizable to your liking. For example, on my home screen I have my google calendar with all my appointments (synchs up with my computer so I dont have to set the same appointment twice for all my devices), my Google Now bar which tells me things like how long it will take to get to work with the given traffic, (it even tells me what the subways are like because I live and work in NYC) what the score of the Yankees game was, etc. I also have the weather, which automatically updates, no opening of apps required, its just there. I think you get the picture now. I just open my home screen once in the morning before pouring my coffee, and I already have started my workday. Its a productivity monster.

4. It needs to last me at least the entire day without any mid-day charges. Some people knock on the battery of this phone. For lack of a better term, they are idiots. The battery on this phone easily gets me through the day with moderate-to-heavy usage no problem. Just to give you an idea: I am always connected to Wifi if available. This is 90% of the time. My home and office. I start the day with about a 95% battery charge around 6:00am, turn off Wifi to commute to the office, and turn it back on for the day until about 6:00pm. At this time I will either go home to recharge (myself, not the phone) or meet friends/co-workers for drinks. When I go out after work, I will get home anywhere between 9:00pm to midnight during the work week. At this point, I have about a 40-45% charge. Needless to say, do not worry about the battery. Its more than enough to not have to worry about. I use the phone to check sports scores, my emails from two different accounts, twitter, texting, the occasional video clips from youtube or wall street journal, briefly look over presentations for work, you get the idea. However, I am not a huge phone-gamer, so I can not speak for that. I am sure it would hold up very well, though.

5. I love the big screens. Personally, I like a lot of real estate with a phone. It allows me to view webpages more easily without the crammed three-words-per-line type of reading experience. This is a major plus with the DNA because it has the 5inch screen (and no, it is not a phablet, it is a PHONE), but it is also very slender and light. It fits into every pocket I have with great ease. It doesn't need a case because of its solid construction, however, if you want a screen protector, more power to you, just not for me. This whole one-handed usage is such nonsense to me. I use this phone with both one or two hands, depends on the situation. The point is that its all easy and comfortable to use. For example, I was on the treadmill the other day and had to send a long and detailed work email out. I composed, proofread and sent the whole thing out while on the treadmill. I used one hand the entire time and I'm still alive. Figure that, Jeff Daniels.

There are obviously a lot of pros, but I will give you my few cons to round out this review:

1. Yes, the unlock button on the top is annoying, however, its only annoying for the first week or so. After that, like anything in life, your muscle memory comes into play and you don't even notice, it's just unlocked. The volume rocker is a different beast though. It blends so nicely into the red grill on the side so its harder to identify. Also, sometimes when i want to raise the volume, i am instead decreasing it. It's annoying at times, but oh well, it's the stupid volume button.

2. Some point out that the charging port, which has a little door, is a con. I think it is neither. You deal with it twice a day, once to open it and once to close it. it is just simply there. I think it actually adds to the aesthetic, in addition to, protecting the port from dust and other things.

3. Only 16gb of internal memory. While it is not very much, just use the cloud. Backup Assistant Plus can store all your photos for no extra charge, thus saving all that space for whatever the hell else you want on your phone.

Anyways, that's about it. Can not think of anything else at the moment. Bottom line: Get this sucker, you will not regret it. You'll find yourself just using it to use it, its fun to have cool technology.

3.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone, Major Drawbacks, January 26, 2013
By 
Tinytim - See all my reviews
This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
To begin with, the HTC Droid DNA is a great phone. It has some of the top specs out of any smartphone available right now. Quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 1080p screen with 440ppi(pixels per inch), 8MP camera, you name it. It is also one good looking phone with it's rubberized texture, red stripes, and that 5-inch screen which isn't too big but isn't too small.

So you may be asking what's wrong with the phone? There are a couple of major drawbacks. First is the non expandable storage: yes it's been stated many times before in previous reviews but this one really got to me. With only 16GB of internal storage, leaving barely under 12GB of usage with all the bloatware installed by Verizon. I thought it wouldn't be a problem, but after importing some of my music library onto the phone, along with pictures and videos that I would take day to day, it would leave me with no memory at all. Yes, I understand that technology is "advancing" to cloud storage, where you can store pictures and videos, but people like me like to have the option of an expandable MicroSD storage slot. It's one of the many things that set Android apart from its competitors!

Second is the battery life/non-removable battery. Having a Droid should mean having the option of a removable battery. If the battery isn't that huge and rates 2,020 mAh, the smart thing to do is to have the option of a removable battery. For some people, the battery would last them all day, but mine hardly lasted for half a day. I use my phone heavily: always playing games, streaming videos, using GPS, using third party apps such as Facebook and Instagram, browsing the internet, etc. and this would leave me with almost no battery by the time 5pm rolls around. Sometimes I would just leave my phone in my pocket and take it out a couple of hours later to find that the battery has drained about 20%. I don't wear tight jeans so there had to be a problem there somewhere, that or the standby battery life is horrible. I always say, what's the point of having a glamorous phone with top specs if you can't use it because it died? Over the two year life of the phone (assuming one would keep the phone for the 2 year contract), the battery will gradually lose life.

Third and lastly, although this complaint isn't as major as the other two, is the button designs. Why would HTC put the power button on top of a 5 inch screen phone? And to add to that, why would they make it so flush into the phone where you can barely feel it unless you have a case on? If someone were to go case-less through the duration of the two years of having the phone, I would imagine the button becoming harder and harder to press or even stuck into the phone.

Although this was a highly anticipated phone for Verizon, I am overall disappointed with the design flaws.

5.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone With Stunning Display, December 7, 2012
By 
Steven Wood - See all my reviews
This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
HTC is one of the leaders when it comes to fit and finish and the DROID DNA is no exception. The One X was already one of the most superior phones in terms of quality, but somehow they were able to step it up. It has a similar polycarbonate back, but it sports more of a soft rubbery touch. The one downside is that it's a fingerprint and smudge magnet. It's almost impossible to keep it smudge free, but hey, who plans on staring at the back of their phone all day? The rubberized feel is non slippery and gives you a fantastic grip.

It's not the thinnest phone in the world because at the highest point it's 9.73mm, but it still feels pretty thin because of the rounded back. The edges are only 4mm thick, but it expands to the center where it hits 9.73mm. It kind of feels like a Hershey's candy bar. That's not a bad thing because when you hold the phone, you place your fingers at the sides which is the thinnest part, while the thickest part rests in your palm and fits perfectly. I know it's a cliche, but it really does feel great in the hand considering it has a whopping 5-inch display. The Samsung Galaxy Note II sports a 5.5-inch display, but is so much bigger when comparing the two. When comparing it to the One X, it's about the same width, but it"s a little taller. My hands are on the smaller side and I had no issues with the size whatsoever. I'm starting to wonder if 5-inches is the new sweet spot.

DESIGN:
What really makes the DROID DNA a thing of beauty is the Lamborghini-inspired aluminum red grill that you will find along the right and left sides. Most manufacturers would have gone with the color silver, but HTC has used red a lot in the past, and it makes the perfect accent on a black phone. You will also find a similar red accent around the 8MP rear camera lens. Overall, the DROID DNA has an EVO type of look, but more polished.

As with most HTC phones, you will find the power button at the top, but this time it sits in the middle. To the left of it is the microphone jack and the SIM slot is to it's right. Along the right side towards the top you will find the volume rocker that sports the same red color as the aluminum red grill. The microUSB port is usually found on the left side on HTC phones, but they finally decided to move it to the bottom, which is the better place. Unfortunately they put a cover on it, which is a little annoying. It's kind of a pain to put back in place, but I guess if you're going to include it, you might as well make it a tight fit. They decided to include the cover because the phone is splash resistant.

Another nice addition is the notification light on the back to the left of the camera lens. It serves two purposes. It lights up for your notifications, but is also lights up when taking a picture.

You won't find a microSD slot for expanding storage, which is a downer for some folks. You get 16GB of storage, which is more than enough for the average user. The other negative is that it's a unibody design, so you won't be able to remove the battery. This could be a deal breaker for some, but more on that later.

In terms of fit and finish, you won't find a better phone than the DROID DNA. The only other phones that are in the same ballpark is the DROID RAZR HD / RAZR MAXX HD and the iPhone 5.

HARDWARE:
If you're going to make a high quality phone, you need to back it up with hardware, and HTC did just that. It packs a 5-inch (1920 x 1080) Super LCD 3 display at 440ppi, a 1.5GHz quad-core Snapdragon S4 Pro CPU, 2GB of RAM, an 8MP rear camera with ImageSense, 2.1MP front facing camera with an 88 degree wide angle lens, 16GB of internal storage, 2020mAh battery, NFC, 4G LTE with worldwide GSM capability, and Beats Audio.

PERFORMANCE:
I already had a chance to try out the Snapdragon S4 Pro on the LG Optimus G so I already had a good idea what to expect. I am happy to report that Sense 4+ doesn't in any way degrade the performance of the quad-core. Coupled with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean, it's blazing fast. It seriously shreds anything you want to throw at it. I know many of you are benchmark fans so I did the obligatory AnTuTu which came in at 14,544. That's considerably higher than the Optimus G's 11.213. Seriously, I'm not sure who can tell the difference, but if you crave power, the DROID DNA will satisfy everything you desire.

DISPLAY:
HTC already had the finest display ever with the One X so what could they possibly do for an encore? The One X sported a Super LCD 2 display at 720p, and the DROID DNA is now a Super LCD 3 at 1080p. It sports 440ppi which is higher than your TV. Some may say it's overkill for a phone, but that's nonsense. It truly is breathtaking as the colors are vibrant, blacks are deep, and everything just pops out at you. As you would expect, the viewing angles are amazing and it performs very well in sunlight. Now if you're familiar with the One X, you will probably find this display to be only marginally better, but it's still an improvement. So to recap: HTC now has the two best displays ever on a smartphone. Not bad at all.

SPEAKERS:
As with all the latest HTC phones, the audio is enhanced with Beats. On top of that, HTC included two amplifiers in the phone. The microphone jack gets its own dedicated 2.55 volt amplifier and the other pushes the rear speaker. This helps minimize distortion at higher volumes. I think HTC is a little underrated when it comes to sound quality. The Beats partnership has always been considered a "marketing" gimmick, but I would rather have it on my phone than not.

BATTERY:
No matter how amazing a phone is, there always seems to be something holding it from being perfect, and the battery just might be the DNA's Achilles heel. I knew going into this review that it was the key, so I spent a considerable amount of time analyzing it. A 1080p screen is going to take its toll on any battery, and a 2020mAh battery is average based on today's standards. HTC reps seemed confident that the Snapdragon S4 Pro is efficient enough to make it work. Unfortunately it's not the case, but it's not complete doom and gloom. It's not like it's as bad as the Verizon Galaxy Nexus, but there are a number of phones that are better. My main test is to run continuous video while connected to 4G LTE, while the display is set at 2/3 brightness, GPS on, WiFi on (not connected), and Bluetooth on (not connected). It yielded 6 hours and 11 minutes. In comparing it to some of the latest phones that I did the same test on, it didn't fare too well:

Motorola ATRIX HD - 4 hours 45 min (this was really bad)
Sony Xperia Ion - 6 hours
DROID DNA - 6 hours 11 minutes
AT&T HTC One X - 7 hours
Sprint LG Optimus G - 7 hours 30 min
DROID Incredible 4G LTE - 7 hours 45 min
DROID RAZR M - 8 hours
AT&T LG Optimus G - 8 hours
Samsung Galaxy Note II - 9 hours 30 min
DROID RAZR HD - About 10 hours
DROID RAZR MAXX HD - 13 hours 30 min
So what does this mean in terms of daily use? With moderate use, you should get about double the times you get in the rundown tests and sometimes more than that with the better performing phones. I was able to get 13 hours while connected to 4G LTE full time, which isn't great, but after living with the Verizon Galaxy Nexus for the past year, it's an improvement. I also tried it while connected to WiFi 90% of the time, and I was able to get a little over 14 hours with about 15% to spare. I then let it sit idle without turning on the display for about 6 hours and it had 4% left. So yes, it made it to 20 hours, which isn't bad, but 6 hours of it was idle time.

Now obviously the display is the biggest culprit here, and all of my tests are done at 2/3 brightness. Some may consider that high, but I like to run tests that are at a level that people would like to see their phone set at with the option of scaling it back. I'm going to see how things go with the display at around 40% brightness and update my results.

Update 1: I'm now getting about 17 hours of life while connected to 4G LTE full time with the display at about 50%. This is with moderate usage and is an improvement over what I got during the review process. It's always been assumed that batteries get better after a few charges, and I have never found this to be the case with most phones. With this particular phone, it really has made a difference. It might have something to do with the Snapdragon S4 Pro, but either way, it's nice to see an improvement.

The bottom line is that the battery is certainly not the main selling point of the DROID DNA, but depending on your situation, it's not too bad if you are able to charge it regularly. For example, I always have a charger in my car and the plus side is this phone is compatible with Qi wireless chargers. There will be an accessory available, but it's also compatible with other 3rd party pads. While in the office, you can conveniently give it a little extra juice. Unfortunately, if you're a hardcore traveler, this phone might not be for you since you won't be able to swap batteries. If there is one thing I am disappointed in with the DNA, it's the battery, but based on my lifestyle, it's not a deal breaker for me.

SOFTWARE:
The DROID DNA features the latest version of Sense, which is 4+ on top of Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean. It's not the latest version of Android, but it should satisfy most people. Sense 4+ hasn't changed all that much from what we saw on the One X and One S, but there are some differences. Navigating between home screens now has the circular carousel that was found in Sense 3, but thankfully it doesn't have the 100 mph spinning animation. The biggest improvement is the keyboard. I hated the Sense keyboard, and now it's more like the keyboards you see on other Android phones. The big change is the numbers/symbol key is to the bottom left instead of the bottom right, which makes a big difference. Other changes are more subtle like more refined fonts and icons, along with some changes to the camera app. Of course you will also get the newer stock Android features like Google Now, expanded notifications, and easier widget placement on home screens. Sense isn't something I desire on a phone, but it's livable when you consider what this phone offers.

As far as running certain apps, such as games, you could run into a problem with the display and compatibility. Brad Molen from Engadget found issues with Need For Speed: Most Wanted and Angry Birds. This is probably due to the display ratio and some games not supporting it. It's probably a temporary issue since more and more phones will be released with similar displays in the near future. As with many of the newer phones, it's expected that a few apps might need to be updated.

As far as bloatware goes, you will find your usual suspects, but they also included a new Amazon app suite. It's similar to the Nexus 7 media widget that shows your recent purchases of books, magazines, and videos. If you are hooked into Amazon, you might appreciate it, otherwise it's just one more annoying carrier add on.

CAMERA:
In my opinion, the One X has the best camera in a smartphone, so I was expecting the same with the DNA. It has the same F/2.0 aperture lens along with ImageSense. I found the pictures to be as good, but no better than the One X. There is at least one improvement with the DNA that I don't believe the One X has, and that's the flash. There are now five levels of brightness for the flash depending on the surroundings. You will also find some differences in the app itself. Some of the menus look a little different, but nothing too drastic. You can change settings for ISO, white balance, shutter, etc., but you can't save them.

CLOSING:
I consider myself lucky that I get to review a lot of different phones, but on the flip side, it can be a little boring since there are so many. Only a few phones really excite me, and I have to say that HTC really excelled this year. Looking back at 2012, I would say I thoroughly enjoyed reviewing the One X and the DROID DNA over any other phone. With that said, is the DROID DNA the ultimate DROID? HTC delivers in just about every category: build quality, display, power, and the camera. Notice how I said "just about"? For me, the battery is the only issue. If it could have had either the DROID RAZR HD or DROID RAZR HD MAXX battery, it would truly be complete, but nowadays it seems as though there is always going to be something missing. For some of you, the lack of a microSD slot is enough to not call this the ultimate DROID, but 16GB is plenty for the average person. Since I am just about 100% in the cloud, it's plenty for me. As I mentioned earlier, the battery isn't a deal breaker for me based on my lifestyle, but because of it, I can't call it the ultimate DROID or even the ultimate smartphone for that matter. What I can say about the DROID DNA is the same as what I said about the One X when I reviewed it: "This is the best Android phone hands down." So it's not the ultimate, but it's oh so close, and I will highly recommend it to anyone that tells me they have $200 to spend on their next smartphone.

5.0 out of 5 stars Do NOT Worry, November 22, 2012

This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
This phone is great. The screen is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The size is perfect. It is a phone....not a phablet. The processor is out of this world. Incredibly snapping all around. The battery life is better than anyone could ask for. The combination of batter and processor do enough to get you through more than the day with normal use. The only negative is the storage. After the preloaded crap you have about 11 gb. This is plenty for standard apps and daily use. You can still fit photos/music on it but without being able to extend it you will need to monitor your use. Outside of that you will not find a more powerful and beautiful device.

I will happily tote this around until my next upgrade.(Was a bit sad losing unlimited data....but didn't really need it anyway.)

5.0 out of 5 stars Best phone on the market., November 26, 2012

This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I tested this phone against the iPhone 5, and Samsung GS3. I walked in to the Verizon store to upgrade my phone, with my mind made up about the iPhone 5. Before setting foot in the store, I'd never heard of the DNA. After an hour of testing a few phones, this was hands down the best phone I tested.

The screen is awesome, it covers the phone from corner to corner, taking full advantage of the size. Browsing the web using 4G is lightning fast, really responsive with very little lag. I've had the phone a week now, and really enjoy using it.

4.0 out of 5 stars More Ice cream Sandwich Please, November 6, 2012
By 
Regan222 - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I have owned this phone for 6 months. It is far and away the best smart phone I have used. I traded up from a Samsung Rogue but have used several different smart phones including the iPhone. The first and best feature is the screen. It is huge and the image is beyond clear. As I grow older I find being able to see and read the screen becomes more important to me.

As a phone, it does everything I need. I would prefer a slide-out keyboard but I am adapting to the on-screen typing. I am also finding that I LOVE the speech to text feature. I use it constantly for everything from filling out forms in the internet to entering address into the navigator. The 4-G connection is very fast, even in the rural area where I live and work. I had read reviews complaining about the battery life when using the smart phone features but I am having no trouble using the phone all day without recharging and I USE all features of the phone.

On the negative side, the phone as shown a tendency to lock up with certain apps, mostly from Google. Since it is easy to reboot or remove the battery I don't view this as a deal breaker but it could become annoying. Fortunately it does not do so very often. That is the only gripe I have with it.

I would highly recommend this phone to anyone, even an iPhone junkie like my wife.

This phone blows everything else I've used out of the water. Smooth, superb design. I'd be happier if it came with the battery of the RAZR Maxx but hey, then it'd be too good to be true, right? I'm more than satisfied, I'm ecstatic to have it! Haven't finished playing with it yet but I came from an S2 and prior to that, an iPhone 4. Nothing really seems to choke this phone yet, even playing GTA3. Everything flies fluidly and without hiccup. Love it!

This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I recently purchased three of these phones to outfit the family. In a word, they are terrific. The phones operate flawlessly, and have a host of features, "apps," and "widgets" that are not only cool, but make organizing and accomplishing necessary daily tasks and routines much easier. The phone is very elegant and stylish, but we have all three cocooned inside Otterbox cases that we purchased from Amazon. I thought this was a much less expensive alternative than the $11 per month PER PHONE that Verizon wanted to charge for insurance. Only time will tell if this was a good decision, but as of now we are very satisified with the phones and its accessories (all of which we purchased from Amazon). All in all, the Samsung Galaxy SIII is an impressive package. Even my son - previously a die-hard Apple iPhone proponent - has switched to Samsung. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

4.0 out of 5 stars Great Phone- DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON WIRELESS!, January 21, 2013
By 
James (Florida, USA) - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
*Beware that Amazon Wireless is separate division and they do not operate under the same guidelines as Amazon*

I've owned this phone for 9 days and used it extensively. Huge upgrade from my Google G2. New Google software seems very fast and smooth. Great camera and the AMOLED display is the best I've seen.

4G LTE is very fast, WHEN I'm connected to it. I find this phone to be on 3G most of the day. My location? Miami, FL which brings me to this complaint I filed with Verizon and Amazon Wireless:

On January 11th 2013 I switched to Verizon Wireless after spending the previous 7 years with their direct competitor. The main reason for my switch was Verizon's marketing and promise of a more reliable & stronger network. I purchased the a Samsung Galaxy S III and as a loyal Amazon Prime member, I did so with confidence and was excited that I had saved $50 off the current Verizon Wireless promotional price.

After using the phone for several days I noticed some technical issues with the device. After spending several hours of my time with the Verizon Wireless technical department, it was determined that this phone was defective (not connecting to the network properly). I was assured by the Verizon Wireless technical specialist that under Verizon's worry-free guarantee, a new phone would be sent free of charge but that I had to contact Amazon Wireless directly in order to process the guarantee.

When I contacted Amazon Wireless I was informed that there was only 2 options for replacing this phone. Amazon Wireless does not honor any Verizon guarantees and they have their own policy's. The first option was to ship this defective device back, thus SURRENDERING MY SERVICE and going without a phone for 5-6 days while they "process" the return. The second option is to pay the FULL RETAIL PRICE of $699, wait 3-4 days for the replacement, and then get a refund 7-10 days after Amazon Wireless received the defective device back.

Let's recap:
Option 1 = No phone for 5-6 days while you ship yours back and then wait for a replacement
Option 2 = Pay $699 + shipping to get a replacement, refund in 7-10 days after they receive defective

When I brought up the fact that the Verizon tech department had informed me otherwise, I was told by the Amazon Wireless representative that "They'll say anything to get you off the phone". I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told nothing else could be done. Both replacement options are clearly unrealistic and unacceptable. Amazon Wireless refused to replace the defective equipment that they sent me.

Beware that Amazon wireless is separate division and they do not operate under the same guidelines as Amazon. Customer service is marginal at best and they will not budge on this policy. Both replacement options that Amazon Wireless presented to me reflect poorly on the Amazon brand. I would strongly suggest buying this phone at a Verizon Wireless corporate retail store.

I switched from the 4G LTE Samsung Galaxy Nexus to the 4G LTE Samsung Galaxy S3. I'm glad I waited until the black color was released. The phone is beautiful in the black finish. Overall compared to the Galaxy Nexus the S3 has a better display, faster speed and a bunch of cool features in the touch wiz that the Galaxy Nexus does not have. I can't wait for the Jelly Bean update for the S3. If you're considering an Android on the Verizon network, I highly recommend the Galaxy S3.

This phone is the best. It outperforms the iPhone every time. Although SVoice isn't the best, it has other features to make up for it. One thing I have been noticing is it overheating whenever I'm not using it. I recommend this phone to anyone, just go for the 32gb because 16gb fills up quickly.

Wow this baby is smoking hot!! I was originally getting the razr Maxx but thank goodness I didn't. The battery life on this lasts an entire day! I've been using it all day long & started out at only 87% at 7am. Now its at 32% & its 8pm & that's heavy use(3d games,hd movies & surfing). The screen is astonishing ..a big step up from my old Motorola phone of 2 years lol. Multitasking is a breeze. I've said enough. This has to be the best phone out right now.

This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I've had the Verizon flavor of this phone for about 2 months now. The phone is great. It was a major upgrade over my last phone the T-Mobile G2x (LG) and my work phone the Droid X2. I'd say my favorite feature improvement is the ability to add emergency numbers that the phone can call when it is locked. I like the idea of a paramedic knowing who to call if I were ever in a car accident. The phone is thin enough that putting the right case on it is no big deal, the phone will still fit easily in my pocket.

The Verizon security app bogged the phone down and didn't work well. I added McAffee WaveSecure and it seems to do a great job.

My only gripes are:
Google Wallet is only supported on the Sprint flavor
the apps menu scrolls side-to-side rather than up and down like my G2x and Droid X2.

Nice slim black case. Upgraded from a Droid Incredible with a Verizon customer appreciation discount and caught the phone on sale. Also bought a 32gig SD card (suggested). The phone is amazing. Beautiful display; blazing fast. LOTS of features to catch up on. I keep the PDF Owners Manual on my desktop for occasional reading and tinkering. With a little tinkering with Battery Life and WiFi settings easily getting 1 1/2 to 2 days battery with moderate usage. Get one!

3.0 out of 5 stars Could have been a contender, January 17, 2013
By 
Bob S (Attleboro, MA USA) - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Not a bad phone, but wish Verizon/Samsung would allow full use of it to the average unrooted user. I bought the 16 gb version (11 gb available for my use) and a 32gb SD card, but the external SD can only be used for storage of pictures, video or music files. Can't place or run any of your apps on the external SD. They also made it much more difficult to access the phone via your USB cable. On my previous (HTC EVO 4G ) phone I could access the SD card like an external disk drive and easily transfer files back and forth. This phone treats your external SD as an afterthought. The carrier and manufacturer are certainly making it more of a necessity for us non-geeks to explore rooting, although I understand that Jelly Bean 4.1.1 has made that a little more difficult, but that will change as the devs have more time to explore. I thought I had done enough due diligence prior to purchase and many of the other competing phones had their own issues

5.0 out of 5 stars The Galaxy Note II is a fantastic device, December 5, 2012
By 
Zain (WI) - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
After checking out the original Galaxy Note at Best Buy last year, I was very interested in the large screen and S Pen features, but since it was an AT&T exclusive, I decided to purchase a Galaxy Nexus. The Galaxy Nexus was a great phone, but it felt like Samsung didn't really put all their effort into making it as premium of a device as the Galaxy Note or the Galaxy S II. Fast forward a year later and Verizon has finally started selling some truly fantastic superphones. I bought the HTC Droid DNA, another phenomenal phone, while I was waiting for Verizon to put their branding on the exterior of the phone in three places, but decided to return it to get the Note II. I'll do a little comparison of both phones and explain why I chose the Note II over the Droid DNA.

Screen - Droid DNA

Nothing in the world can touch the DNA's 1080p screen. Nothing. No matter how close I got to the screen, I could never see any pixels. Text looked amazing and colors were incredibly accurate. While the Note II has a "measly" 720p panel stretched over a 5.55" display, the screen itself is still significantly better than the Galaxy Nexus. Samsung chose to remove the PenTile pixel arrangement that it chose for the Galaxy Nexus in 2011, a choice that makes text and graphics on the screen appear much smoother. As it is a Super AMOLED HD panel, it is still going to have the fantastic blacks and supersaturated colors of the Galaxy Nexus (unlike the Droid DNA's LCD screen), but I actually don't really mind the saturation. Colors really pop, and since I'm not a professional photographer, I'm not enraged by the slight dip in accuracy for the increase in color intensity. The DNA's screen is clearly better, but the Note II's screen is still very good.

Phone Construction - Tie (for different reasons)

Let me preface this section with the statement that the Droid DNA has absolutely incredible build quality. The phone feels very solid and its designers clearly put a great deal of care into its creation. The Galaxy Note II, of course, is made of Samsung's trademark plastic finish. This, unfortunately, feels less solid than the DNA. However, I quickly found problems with the DNA's build, which was one of the reasons I decided to return it. The DNA is made of a mishmash of materials: soft touch matte black polycarbonate on the back, glossy black plastic on the front, red spun metal hairline finish for the buttons, and a different shade of red for the grilles on the sides of the phone. As an aside, these grilles are entirely superfluous, they do not enhance the sound quality of the phone in any way.

After owning my DNA for 10 days, I noticed several things. First, I found several dents in the grilles on the side, something which was rather alarming for a company renowned for its build quality. In addition, the back of the phone started developing scuffs that would not go away when rubbed with a damp cloth. I did not use a case for this phone because I had assumed that the material would be somewhat sturdy, especially considering the level of care I had put into handling it. While the Galaxy Note II is indeed plastic, its exterior is much more scratch and scuff resistant. I have had the Note II for almost a week now and there is nary a mark to be found. Additionally, even if the back does get scratched up somehow, it can always be replaced with a brand new back, as it is user removable (perhaps you could even upgrade to one without two garish Verizon logos on it). I actually really like the "Hyperglaze" finish on the Note II - it looks especially handsome in dark gray. It adds something very sophisticated to the Note II's exterior that was definitely missing in my old Galaxy Nexus. The Droid DNA is slightly more comfortable to hold than the Note II, but for a 5.55" phone, Samsung really did a good job in making it as ergonomic as possible. Also, Samsung's button placement is far superior to HTC's. Who would ever decide to put the power button on the top of such a tall phone?? Oh wait, HTC and Apple...

Internals - Note II

Both phones have quad core processors (Snapdragon S4 Pro for the DNA, Samsung's own Exynos 4 for the Note II) which excel at annihilating lag. They also have 2 GB of ram, although I think the Note II utilizes it better than the DNA (which has to deal with the overly-vigilant multitask killing in HTC Sense 4+). They both have GSM/CDMA/LTE radios, which is a nice addition if you want to use your phone globally in addition to getting great LTE service in the US. I got great reception everywhere I went with both phones, definitely better than the poor radios in the Galaxy Nexus.

Each phone comes with an 8MP rear camera, both of which take excellent pictures. They both have numerous features, including a rapid shot mode, but Samsung has significantly more. These extra features may be of limited use, but they are still fun to play around with. The Droid DNA has a wide angle lens for its front facing camera, so you can have more people in your Facebook shots, but the Note II's front facing camera isn't bad by any means.

After this is where the phones really start to differ. Although each phone comes with 16 GB of storage, the Note II, thanks to its removable back, has an SD card slot allowing for a MicroSD card of up to 64 GB. I heard that Verizon forced HTC to offer only one 16 GB version of the Droid DNA with no SD card slot (unlike the Japanese version of the phone) because they want their customers to use more cloud based services (and of course rake in the money from tiered data caps). The Note II comes with a 3100 mAh battery, while the Droid DNA has a paltry 2020 mAh one, meaning that the Note II's battery is 1.5 times as large. In addition, Samsung gave the Note II a removable battery, a nice feature to have if you need a fully charged phone right after draining the battery. Fun fact, the battery of the Note II is the size of the iPhone 4S's entire screen.

The Note II does indeed come with its defining feature, the S Pen. The display was built with Wacom technology, which allows for 1024 levels of pressure sensitivity (4 times what the original Note has), so this is definitely a stylus for content creation. I am not at all artistic, so my drawing exploits were limited to making a smiley face in S Note (which, admittedly, came out perfectly). I've used the S Pen for writing text messages and other text input, but I feel like the onscreen keyboard is still faster. As another aside, the S Pen is incompatible with the capacitive buttons on the Note II, so there are two shortcuts you have to use instead of pressing menu and back. You hold the S Pen's button and make a caret, ^ for menu and a less than symbol, < for back. It's a little annoying, but I guess it makes sense.

The Galaxy Note II comes with a RGB notification light in the front. It is not hard to miss when you have a notification, and I really like it. The DNA actually has two notification lights, one in the grille in the front and another to the left of the camera in the back. These can only glow green and amber, which is sad. Also, they are very hard to see and notice if you are not looking at them head-on, as they are recessed. Notification lights are one of the best things about Android in my mind, and I am very glad to see that both manufacturers included them.

The Droid DNA includes wireless charging capabilities, which Verizon decided to remove from the Note II (literally, they covered up the wireless charging contacts with plastic), which is definitely a win for the DNA. I wanted a phone with wireless charging, but I'll live. On the other hand, the DNA has a ridiculous microUSB port door that I just wanted to rip off. Supposedly it is to make the phone more water resistant, but I don't know if that's worthwhile when the tradeoff is so obnoxious.

The Verizon Galaxy Note II has a Verizon logo on the home button, unlike the Note II on every single other phone carrier. When I went into a Verizon store to ask if the screenshots on the preorder page that had the home button logo were true, the representative told me that I should be happy that they put the logo on the phone in so many places. Do you know why? It is because I wouldn't want my friends, or even random strangers, thinking that I had a phone on an "inferior" carrier like Sprint or AT&T. They should know that I have the great 4G LTE coverage that Verizon offers...ridiculous. Fortunately, after searching for "Verizon Note 2 home button cover," I found that someone was selling stickers to cover that inane logo. I haven't received mine yet, but hopefully it will not be too much of a hassle. Spigen is also selling a set of home button covers on Amazon, but I didn't think that they matched as well as the eBay ones.

Software - Note II

After owning only the original Motorola Droid and the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, I had never really experienced carrier skins, but I knew that when I was going to choose a phone that I would have to use either Samsung's Touchwiz or HTC's Sense. Both phones are running Android 4.1.1 Jelly Bean, but to me it feels like Sense is stuck in the past of Froyo and Gingerbread *shudder*. Samsung's interface feels much more modern and updated, with most things being very well integrated from Jelly Bean into Touchwiz. On the other hand, Sense feels like it just slapped some new features from Jelly Bean on top of its old interface. Samsung exclusively uses the blue accents Android gained in Ice Cream Sandwich, while Sense has a horrible amalgamation of Sense green accents with a smattering of ICS blue ones. Additionally, features that I really love about Android, like getting to see the entire body of a text message as it goes through the status bar without having to pull down the notification tray, are completely missing in Sense. Why HTC, why?

Both phones have lock screen applications, which is definitely nice, but Sense gives you a built-in series of themes to choose from that lets you change both the lock screen as well as the color of all settings menus. This is nice, but half of them were pretty ugly, so I just stuck with one for the whole time. In addition, Verizon was nice enough to permanently install a good number of applications on both phones. Many of these can be disabled by going to Settings-->Application Manager and then clicking on the list of all applications to uninstall the ones you don't want, but some of them (like Verizon's visual voicemail client) are permanent.

I think that Android has always had more features than iOS but that iOS has always had more polish to it. After Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean, I no longer find this to be true. Jelly Bean looks fantastic, and it is also very feature-rich. iOS on the other hand has stagnated. I owned the original iPhone and the iPhone 4, and other than the increased resolution (and the ability to add home screen backgrounds), the software on both phones looks practically identical. iOS, although once groundbreaking, now looks positively gaudy, with many of its apps containing over-the-top skeumorphic design - Game Center and Podcasts come to mind as particularly egregious examples. Android now offers a nice, clean interface that has finally caught up to iOS in terms of visual flair.

Jelly Bean isn't the massive overhaul that Ice Cream Sandwich was, but it definitely has some nice new features that I enjoy using. By long pressing on the home button and clicking on the Google icon, you can get to Google Now. Here, Google combines information that it already knows about you into sets of "cards" that appear throughout the day at (hopefully) the most helpful time. For instance, when I bought a case and screen protector for my Note II, there was a card that told me that my package had shipped with UPS two day shipping, and it gave me the option to track it or view the confirmation email from Amazon. Google Now also tells you the local weather for the next three days, traffic home from work and other frequently visited places, and sports scores for your favorite teams. In addition, by saying "Google" or pressing the speech button while in Google Now, you can use Google's enhanced voice actions. Here, Google uses its algorithms to answer questions about people and places. You can ask it math questions, set alarms, send texts, call people, and do a ton of other things. Somehow, Google has done something to make these voice searches incredibly quick and accurate, often much more so than Apple's voice assistant Siri. If you want to see a funny video of the two compared, search on YouTube for "Google Search vs. Siri App Judgment" and skip to 3:31 in the video, it really shows how well Google's voice recognition algorithm works. Another feature introduced in Jelly Bean is expandable/actionable notifications. When I get a text message, I can drag down with two fingers on the notification to expand it to see the entire message. This also works with emails and many other types of notifications, as long as the developer has enabled it.

Touchwiz has added a huge number of features to Jelly Bean. Here is a list of some of my favorites.
-Notification bar toggles: these are helpful if you want to turn Bluetooth on or change the screen brightness throughout the day without having to delve into system settings. Unfortunately, Verizon decided that it wanted to have a Wi-Fi notification as a separate ongoing notification instead of being built into the toggle.
-Call setting notification: when you're on a call, there is now a notification that allows you to turn on speakerphone, go to the dialer, or even end the call, which is extremely helpful.
-Smart stay: when you're looking at the phone, if the screen is about to turn off, it checks to see if your eyes are still on the screen or not. If they are, it does not turn the display off.
-Smart rotation: when you rotate the phone (like, if you decide to lay down), the phone checks to see if your head also rotated, or if you actually want the screen to change orientation.
-One handed operation: admittedly, this is a big phone. With one handed operation, you can choose to shrink the keyboard, dialer, calculator, or even unlock pattern to one side of the screen, which makes using the phone with one hand a lot more manageable.
-Blocking mode: this silences your phone at certain times during the day (for instance, if you want to sleep without waking up for calls or texts) with exceptions for certain people. Verizon decided that its customers did not need this feature, so they hid it, but it is easy to enable. Just Google "how to enable blocking mode on Verizon Note II" and there are plenty of tutorials showing how to get it back.

Of course, Touchwiz has some annoying points, but I have found that I don't really mind it too much so far. I prefer it by far to Sense, which felt like it was always treating me like a child.

Miscellaneous

The Galaxy Note II gets phenomenal battery life. On my Galaxy Nexus, I would be lucky to get 1.5-2 hours of screen on time, and I would always have to switch batteries by the afternoon. With the Droid DNA, I was getting around 3-3.5 hours of screen on time, which was enough for most days, but if I used it more than that, I was tethered to a charger. Yesterday, my Galaxy Note II was unplugged for 19 hours with nearly 6 hours of screen on time before it (and I) needed to be recharged. I just cannot believe how good the battery life is on the Note II, especially considering the size of its screen. You can buy extra batteries, but I'm not actually sure if I will, since my battery life has been so good.

The Note II has many accessories available for it, unlike the Droid DNA. This is probably because the DNA is exclusive to Verizon whereas the Note II is being sold worldwide and on all the carriers in the US. If you want to get official accessories (flip covers, media docks, etc.), you should be aware that if you register your Note II on Samsung's website that they actually give you a 50% off coupon on all the accessories on their website, which is a ridiculously good deal.

Due to its exterior, the Note II feels somewhat slippery, so I would recommend getting a slim fitting case at the very least. I got one from Amazon called the Ringke Slim and I love it. My S Pen hasn't scratched the screen (which is not surprising, considering that it is Gorilla Glass 2), but I decided to get a screen protector just in case. I'm not sure how necessary this was, but for such an expensive phone, it was worth it to protect my purchase.

I hope that in this 3000 word review of the Galaxy Note II I have been able to answer all of the questions you had about it. If you have any other questions that I can answer, feel free to leave a comment below. The Galaxy Note II is by far the best phone I have ever used, and I am positive that I made the correct decision in purchasing it over the Droid DNA.

5.0 out of 5 stars The best by a significant margin, December 15, 2012
By 
Steven W. Rose (Haliimaile, HI United States) - See all my reviews
(REAL NAME)   
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
The Note II has many excellent features unmatched by any other product.

Due to its Verizon 4G connection and high capacity battery, it can work as a hot spot all day. My Clear (Sprint) hot spot would only run for 3 hours, so I had to carry three spare batteries. The Note II hot spot functionality takes seconds to turn on (or off). The Clear hot spot takes more than a minute to establish a connection. The Verizon 4G connection is widely available. Sprint seems to be turning off WiMax, as my coverage has been shrinking. As a result, the Note II pays for itself as I can terminate my Clear hot spot. And there is now less to carry. The iPhone 5 4G as a hotspot did not have enough battery life.

Due to its very good audio system, I was able to use it for a Skype conference the first day I had it. The Skype connection from the regular conference room setup was not working well. I connected from the Note II, and suddenly everyone could hear and be heard. The audio from the phone would have been enough, but it was easy to plug the local amp and speakers into the headphone jack, and continue to use the telephone's microphone. It saved the meeting.

Skype video conferencing is also excellent, and works really well on the go.

Be sure to buy the Samsung HDMI output adapter. There is a new standard connector -- the micro USB has 11 pins. It works fine with regular microUSB cables for data and charging, but requires a different connector than previous microUSB HDMI adapters. You will be amazed at the quality of the image on your HDTV. BTW, position matters. For Google Earth, for example, if you hold the phone upright, the image is narrow and vertical. Put the phone in landscape position, and the screen fills with a beautiful high resolution image.

The camera is excellent for a cell phone camera -- better in a resolution chart test than my iPhone 4. Due to the height of the phone, the camera lens is outside of my shirt pocket, so it can take videos while in your pocket leaving both hands free (takes getting used to -- practice first). Which brings up another point -- it fits fine in every shirt pocket I have, in spite of its size. Be sure to do something that will keep it from slipping out when you bend over, though (antislip material, or a case, for example) if you chose to carry it there.

AirDroid is a most amazing app that works really well with this phone. Call it up in the browser on your computer, point your phone at the screen and press the camera icon, and it uses a bar code to instantly log in and allow you to transfer files at high speed between your computer and your phone. This app is a breakthrough for me in increasing the utility of my phone.

In fact, the phone is almost at the point where it can replace my computer. With its quad core cpu, excellent graphics, and 64GB of external (microSDXC) storage, the addition of a bluetooth keyboard and external monitor turns it into a computer, with the phone functioning as a multitouch mousepad and Wacom graphics tablet (thanks to the S Pen!)

It is easy to go on and on about this telephone and the apps available, like afterfocus and fast boot, and the fact that the video camera offers both fast motion and slow motion (240 frames/sec at standard definition). While the still photo resolution of telephone cameras in general is not up to say a Canon SD780is pocket camera, the Note II's still quality is still excellent, and the video is wonderful. Every day there is something new to discover about this great device (and an excellent series of tutorials on YouTube).

Aloha,
Steve

5.0 out of 5 stars Best gadget ever, December 10, 2012
By 
BadMedicineLK (South Carolina) - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
First 2 questions I get when someone sees this device: is that a phone? Does it fit in your pocket? No, its a blender. No, it doesn't fit in my pocket I have to wear a backpack to carry it around. But seriously, it is big for a phone, but it fits in every pocket of pants that I wear easily. I sold my Galaxy Tab 10.1 and my Galaxy S III for this phone. I hate the word phablet, but it is truly both. The screen size allows for all types of media consumption comfortably. The hardware along with JellyBean make the Note II the smoothest Android experience to date. I mean no slowdowns, stutters, or crashes of any kind. Besides having the functionality of a phone, you get many features including S-Pen and a great camera, which in combination makes for something special, and a big battery for the long trips.

I am not an artist, but the S Pen makes it super easy to experiment with. It is really fun and easy (once you know about them) to explore through the features, although I do recommend downloading "User's Digest: Samsung Galaxy NoteII" from the Playstore. It is a basic, yet informative guide that takes you through many of the S-Pen features. And there are many!

The battery life on this device is fantastic. I am averaging 30 hours between charges with medium to heavy use (4-6 hours of screen time), and that's usually with 10-15% left (I don't like running the Li-Ion battery all the way down). There's now a battery on the market that more than doubles the capacity of the stock 3100 mah battery (obviously sacrificing bulkiness and weight) for those of you that never want to put this thing down. But for me, this is plenty of battery life and I am truly impressed considering the thickness and reasonable weight.

The camera is great. There are many features including burst mode, panorama, best picture, and many more. The camera has some trouble in low light conditions, like most cellphone cameras, but it still gets the job done. Under normal lighting conditions the results can be compared to a point and shoot. But where the magic takes place is what you can do with all of your pictures. The camera paired with the S-Pen functionality make the possibilities endless. You can hand write captions, easily crop and paste custom selections from anything that's on screen at any time by tracing with the pen, you can add all kinds of crazy effects and then easily share your creations instantly with NFC, email, text, Facebook, etc. As "slogany" as this sounds, it really does inspire you to get creative.

I do have one criticism of the Note II. And it is by no means a deal breaker. The audio from the 3.5mm headphone jack. Music is not nearly as crisp or punchy as the Galaxy S III. I compared them both side by side. Bass is not as deep and sound range is tighter in general. You can compensate by tweaking the equalizer (I use a paid MP3 player app : PowerAmp, its awesome), but it's still not the same. I checked some forums and people seem to agree; most point fingers to the possible use of a weaker DAC chip (Digital to Analog Converter). Now, don't get me wrong, I still listen to music on it all the time, but it is a minor disappointment.

Taking the time to learn and explore the features will make your experience much more enjoyable with this device. There's a lot packed in there, so be patient. Samsung deserves a lot of credit to have the balls to make a device that many people thought was too big and would never sell. I'm glad they took the risk because this is everything I've ever wanted from a phone/universal tool.

UPDATE (2/1/13): After almost 2 months with the Note II I am still extremely pleased. No dropped calls. No OS crashes. No really big problems whatsoever. A few things that I missed initially: the camera has an incredible slow motion mode that can record up to 1/8th of the normal frame rate in good quality. Very cool to see and experiment with. And it also offers a fast motion mode that is awesome for filming time-lapse's such as sunsets or road trips (mount it on the dashboard of a long road trip... very cool).

Also, since my initial review I have rooted, unlocked the bootloader, and flashed a custom ROM. Please do a lot of research before you do this and also realize this will void your manufacturer warranty. With the custom ROM I am getting ridiculous battery life. The best I've seen so far is 63 hours of time between charges with 7 hours of screen time with the stock battery. This was predominantly over WiFi and in good cell coverage when I wasn't at home or work. Regardless, without the bloatware and running an optimized ROM this phone is even more beastly and it will only get better as developers continue to pave the way for this phone. Hop on the bandwagon now!

5.0 out of 5 stars Huge - and AWESOME! Powerful amazing device, December 11, 2012
By 
ewizzle - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I really am loving this device. More than I thought I would. The screen is beautiful and big, fast, smooth, and bright. Very little downside for me.

PROS:
--Bright Screen

--Fringer Print coating - I haven't heard anybody talk about the coating on the screen, but it is one of my favorite feature! It is like working on silk, and it doesn't pick up finger print even close to what my previous phones did. REally has a luxury feel.

--Battery life - HUGE factor for me. I can get through a regular moderate use day, and still have 30-40% batter when I get home. CRAZY GOOD! This can even be improved with tighter control over the settings for sure.

--Removable battery - AND if the giant 3100mAh batter isn't enough, you can swap it out!

--Speed - FAST FAST FAST!

--SD card slot - up to 64BG on top of the 16GB on board

--Android 4.1 Jelly Bean - I think they have finally passed iOS with this version. Super fast smooth, and TON of cool gesture features available.

--LED light on the front is great for notification without having to turn on the phone

--Home Button - At 1st I didn't like it, but with such a big phone, it is really handy to beable to wake it up with the home button, and not have to reach up the side

--Design- much improved over the Note I - thinner, buttons are more reachable. Very premium feel, even though it is all plastic. I'm surprised how much I like it.

--Camera - lots of cool features and effects, and it is SUPER FAST

--Touch Wiz - lots that I'm not a huge fan of, but the lock screen widgets are great. Otherwise, I switched to Nova Launcher, and LOVE IT! This really sold the device for me. Touch wiz isn't great, but not horrible either. Nova Launcher erases most of the annoyance for me (including having to look at Verizon Bloat ware in the app drawer) - SO EASY TO CUSTOMIZE!

--S-PEN - I almost forgot! Very easy to use, needs more apps, but the ones that work well are beautiful. It writes almost better than a regular pen.

--Phone - volume on the speaker and ear piece are fine. Very load and clear.

LOVE THIS PHONE!

CONS

--Touch Wiz - The settings are scattered all over, some in the settings, some in the individual apps. More centralized would be better. customized notification bar is so-so. Wish I could re-arrange the icons and shrink them. Pure JellyBean is much better (ESPECIALLY on 4.2).

--Size - NOT A CON for me! I used my old iphone last night and it felt like a tiny little toy. Almost unusable. I love the giant screen, but if you have small hands it will probalby be too big. I'm 6" with large hands, but it is easier to drop...

--Very Slick - I had to get a case because it is so smooth and slippery. Very easy to drop. I found a decent bumper case that isn't too bulky, and adds enough grip to feel more comfortable.

Anything else..... NOT REALLY! Android apps aren't always the best available, but the level of customization is so huge, It is worth breaking out of the Apple and Microsoft walled gardens. (Yes, I said Microsoft too! - just spend two years with WP7, and it is just as closed as apple...IMO)

5.0 out of 5 stars I Made Fun Of It, Then Hung My Head in Shame, January 9, 2013
By 
T.C. (Dallas, TX USA) - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
One of my friends got the original Galaxy Note a while back. She was rather petite, and I thought it was hilarious! Whenever she held it up to her face to talk on it, all you could really see was this big phone tablet lovechild...thing. Then, her sister got the Galaxy Note 2 last month. It was even bigger! I unleashed a barrage of playful jesting at her as well. Who would want such a big device for a phone?
It then came time for me to upgrade. I had been using a HTC Thunderbolt, so most anything would have been an upgrade. I even had the extended battery, the one that stuck out from the back like it was a hideously deformed hellspawn and belonged in the bell tower at Notre-Dame Cathedral. All in all, it wasn't a terrible phone...but the battery would barely last a day with moderate use (and that was the extended), and the phone itself was prone to quirks that caused problems now and then. In addition to that, the processor is a few generations old now and it certainly showed! I was extremely ready to upgrade.
I had it narrowed down to a few phones...I wanted a Nokia 920, but Verizon didn't have it yet. So I looked at the Droid DNA, and the Razr Maxx HD. I wasn't even CONSIDERING the Note 2.

The more research I did though, the more it got frustrating.
I loved the size, look, and feel of the Droid DNA, but I already had been burned by one HTC phone with an under-powered battery. To add insult to injury, with the Droid DNA the battery wasn't even replaceable and I would be stuck with 16GB of non-expandable memory. I could make it work maybe, but battery life and storage are important to me. The answer was nein.

Razr Maxx HD...Motorola makes solid phones. It was rugged, it had lots of nice bells and whistles, was a good size, and the battery life looked great! I've never had a phone with above average battery life, the possibilities were tantalizing. But..it was only dual core (not a big deal, but to a techy guy like me it's enough to make me hesitate with more quad processors coming out and all), and the camera wasn't very impressive. Not terrible, but meh. I do take pictures a lot, so I ideally wanted the best phone camera I could get to save me from perpetually having to carry around my 7D. This was the stronger contender of the two, but it was disappointing that I would have to compromise so much either way. Plus, after holding it, I just didn't dig the shape of the phone. I could have certainly made it work and I probably would have been happy with it-- but that didn't mean it was the best choice for me.

Then I read more about this thing and got to play with it.
I fell in love. It does everything well. Why compromise when, if I can deal with .5" increase in size from the Droid DNA, I could have a phone that wouldn't lack in any of those previously mentioned departments?
That's the bottom line with the Note 2: "If you can deal with the size." Personally, I think a 5" phone is ideal, but 5.5" is definitely manageable for me.
It's not for everyone. I have big hands, and I can operate the thing with one hand pretty easily (Samsung's one handed mode keyboard helps). It's a good size for me, and even my female friend who is considerably smaller than me can operate it well. It takes some getting used to though. It fits in my jeans pockets, but I bought a Seido ACtive case w/holster just in case (hah! Get it?). Been using that with no problems.
I do not regret getting it.
This is the best phone, or phablet, or whatever it is, I've ever had. I'm on my third day of one battery charge here, with light use in addition to using this thing as a music player while I drive. I bought a 64 GB card and use this as my music player now, rather than pay an extra few hundred for a 64GB ipod which I was originally intending on doing. The interface doesn't skip a beat, games run flawlessly, the s pen is surprisingly useful, and the camera is very good! No connection issues either. 4G runs fast, wifi works just fine, but I haven't tried bluetooth yet. I'm optimistic this phone may actually make it so I'm not yearning for my next upgrade date.

So to put it plainly... I'm sorry Galaxy Note 2. I'm sorry for making fun of you.. *sniff*. People may make fun of you for being a phablet, but I know better. You were just made awesome.

5.0 out of 5 stars everything you'd want and (maybe) more than you need, January 6, 2013
By 
Tara "peacefulseraph" (USA) - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I just bought this phone and it's really amazing. The instructions that come with it are minimal, so you may need to look up what certain functions do online... The s-pen is astoundingly practical, compared to what I imagined- a flimsy Blackberry stylus, and unintuitive screen. How wonderfully wrong I was! I downloaded Autodesk Sketchbook Mobile app and it really takes drawings to another level. I have an old 12" Wacom tablet, and this is as good as it ever was. I also have a Cintiq for work, but it's not quite at that level (in case you were wondering).

I think the main drawback is hidden options. You have to go through many a menu just to do anything.There are almost too many options as well like: how do you want your phone to vibrate when different people call you... there are 5+ options including a heartbeat, jingle bells, and the waltz- who needs that stuff? I'm happy when you can personalize ringtones to separate personal and professional calls.

Even though its length is approximately the length of a dollar bill, it's much lighter than it looks even with this big of a phone. I didn't have any trouble with the keyboard despite having broad fingers... there was more than enough space to hit the letters on the keypad with accuracy.

Great phone for $199!

With Galaxy Note II and Smart Dock you no longer need a tablet, portable game console, home game console, media streamer, laptop/desktop PC, notepad and pen, etc. This device has the power, versatility and features to do it all with industry leading battery life while still fitting in your pants pocket. This is the future of mobility.

5.0 out of 5 stars Samsung Galaxy Note 2/ Verizon, December 8, 2012
By

(REAL NAME)   
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Love this phone!

BEWARE about chatting with the support people on the Samsung site for this product.

The two different times I chatted about technical issues were disappoinging. The people are not trained well and frankly they don't know what they are talking about. I have not called the help number 1-888-987-4357. They may be more technical.

The support people on the chat will go through a procedure with you. If it is not resolved they will tell you to DO A SOFT RESET. If that does not work, they will tell you to do a HARD RESET. Don't do a HARD RESET, unless you want to start over again with all your settings.

Issue number 1,
I have recored video on the phone. (even small amount of video can create large file). I wanted to share it via email. So I clicked on my Yahoo email account and went through the process of figuring out where the file was stored. For me it was on my external micro sd card. So you must attach it. With yahoo email, I could not attach it. The chat person asked me to do a soft reset. This is shutting the phone off and removing the battery for thirty seconds and then starting up the phone. This did nothing for the issue. When the chat person told me to do a hard reset, I exited the chat conversation.

RESOLUTION
I also have an gmail account. The file easily attached to this email account. But remember it can take a long time to process a big file.

Issue number 2,

I bought an external case that gives support to the phone. Nothing on the display. I started to adjust the "motion settings" on the phone. I thought it would be cool when the phone is sitting on my desk to just move my hand over the proximity sensors to awaken the phone to see if there were messages. I could not get it work. There are other cool "motion settings" as well that I adjusted that would not work either.
Same answer as above from the chat person. But went so far to tell me that the "motion settings" have to be activated first by enabling the power button on the phone. Not only is this untrue, but it goes against the purpose of developing the "motion settings".

RESOLUTION
When I had removed the case to do a soft reset, the "motion settings" worked. Yes everything worked without the phone in the case. I do not know why since the proximity sensors are on the outside top and not covered by the case. But never the less, my "motion settings" will not work with my case. I would rather have the case on for protection.

If you have discovered RESOLUTIONS to issues, please post.

Update- as soon as I posted the above, the "motion settings" now work in my case. I swipe from left to right. Sorry for the confusion. But it is all about the awareness and being able to figure things out as you go. Enjoy this fabulous phone. BTW if you are on a limited data plan, make sure in your home you have the "wifi" turned on.

5.0 out of 5 stars Some quick notes after a month of owning this phone, February 13, 2013
By 
Mike Tarrani "Jazz Drummer" (Deltona, FL USA) - See all my reviews
(TOP 500 REVIEWER)    (HALL OF FAME REVIEWER)    (COMMUNITY FORUM 04)    (REAL NAME)   
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
There are already some excellent reviews, so I am going to try not repeating what has already been written. Instead, I am going to list a few reasons why I love this phone, plus one big caveat. The caveat first: when I got my first smartphone - a Motorola Droid X - I was equally pleased at this point in the ownership cycle. At month 18 that phone became a nightmare. So, factor that in as I gush about how great this phone is.

My comparisons are going to be to the Droid X:

- I cannot believe the battery life! I am no longer tethered to a charger. One three hour phone conversation dropped my battery to 73 percent. And it charged back up to 100% when I did plug it into a charger in less than 20 minutes. Note: this is a relatively new phone with a new battery. I doubt I would get the same results a year from now when the battery is worn by numerous charging cycles. Still, since I routinely go the entire day without charging it, only putting it on charge when I go to bed, the wear and deterioration of the battery will probably be far less than for other phones.

- Boot-up time is amazingly quick. My previous phone took what seemed to be forever to come up in a ready state after restarting it or powering it back on. This one does it in literally seconds.

- Signal strength is as good, if not better, than the phone it replaced. That was a relief because I had heard horror stories about this and the S III. In fact, the Motorola phone was legendary for it's antenna and receiving/transmitting systems and this phone is certainly its equal.

- Speaker volume and reception are vastly superior to the Motorola.

I transferred my SD card directly from my Droid X to this phone and all of its contents were immediately recognized by the Note 2. I did have to recreate my play lists for my music, which may have been stored in the internal memory of the Droid X. Still, that was a relief to not have to recreate everything.

Although this phone is supposed to be locked down I have added apps to it with no problems, so for me that aspect is not an issue.

One accessory that I found to be essential to protect the phone is an Evecase Leather Wallet Case with Stand and Credit Card Holder for Samsung Galaxy Note 2 II N7100 - Black.

As for the size - it is not a problem for me. In fact, I an getting older and the larger form factor - while not cool or trendy - suits me perfectly.

The phone is, if anything, too responsive. The screen is sensitive to your every touch. Sometimes my finger lands or overlaps areas adjacent to where I wanted to touch and the phone responds before I can correct it. That is a minor issue and many folks will probably not experience it.

Since this phone is practically a tablet I purchased an HDE® Silver Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 Keyboard, which makes it super-easy to use for web surfing and creating and developing documents with Polaris Office 4.0 that shipped with my phone.

If there is anything to complain about it's Verizon itself. I had to change from my unlimited data plan to their far more restrictive one in order to upgrade. I am not pleased about that and consider it to border on unethical. I've been with Verizon since 1999 and have been very loyal - until now. And since this reviews is about Verizon's version of this phone I think my comment about this is valid.

On the iPhone vs. Galaxy comparisons: I have friends who have iPhones and they have admired my Note 2, but are not about to switch. I can see their point. They are comfortable with that device's interface and features and have no compelling reason to switch. I mention this because that comparison seems to frequently crop up and it truly has no relevance in my opinion. Most folks who are used to Apple are probably going to stay with that platform, and the newer ones seem to have close to the same features judging from one of my friend's 4S model.

As I mentioned above, time will tell about this phone. Right now I am thoroughly pleased with mine, but who knows? Latent flaws could surface in the future that change my opinion. If so I will come back and update this review.

By 
Batman777 - See all my reviews
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I have the Note I and wanted to mention something for those who are thinking about buying the Note II.

After almost a year, I wouldn't trade my Note for anything else but the Note II. Everytime I go into a store, I don't see anything else I would rather have.

People sometimes ask about the Note size, and I respond by telling them the device seems to get smaller and smaller each day. It's just that most ppl are used to a teeny tiny screen. It fits nicely into jean front pockets and my jean jacket shirt pockets.

The Note is more than a phone and with its size, it is actually usable without a magnifying glass. Videos, pics, e-mails, txt msg, games, etc are all very easy to use and see.

Dialing is a snap without fumbling on the keys. The audio is loud for playback. I hope Samsung does not take away the stylus since is very useful to make a quick note, pointer or drawing. I wished the Note One had the LED notification indicator like the Note II. So that is a selling point for me on the Note II.

The 8Meg camera takes the best pics and videos ever. I rarely use my still camera anymore. I just pull out the Note and use it for all pics.

We could go on forever talking about the Note and Note II. They just keep getting better. I'm running Android ICS on the Note One and it is great. I hear the Note II battery is very long lasting -> Li-ion 3,100mAh...
