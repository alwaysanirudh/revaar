==UPDATE 3 Mar '13=== A Titan Grey version of the Galaxy S III Mini i8190 is

So I bought this phone to replace an iPhone 4. Been having it for 2 years and
the antennagate issue's been getting worse especially this year... So I
thought I'd make a small phone upgrade and I got the S3 Mini...

**Amazon Verified Purchase**([What's this?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase))

**This review is from: Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III Mini Unlocked Android Smartphone - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)**

==UPDATE 3 Mar '13=== A Titan Grey version of the Galaxy S III Mini i8190 is
also available with some of the very same Amazon sellers now!

  
So I bought this phone to replace an iPhone 4. Been having it for 2 years and
the antennagate issue's been getting worse especially this year... So I
thought I'd make a small phone upgrade and I got the S3 Mini.

  
My thoughts on this phone after using it for 2 months.

  
BEWARE: Before buying this phone, CHECK YOUR MOBILE CARRIER'S NETWORK
BROADCASTING FREQUENCY BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE, THIS IS A POTENTIAL
INCOMPATIBILITY IF YOU HAVEN'T CHECKED.

==================================================================

  
Pros:

-Very light for its size, isn't too big  
-3.5G is pretty fast (Btw the power saver feature can throttle your bandwidth aka internet "speed" apart from the processor)  
-Android 4.1 preloaded  
-Very smooth UI  
-Still has the good multitasking feature on GS3  
-(Call Quality) So I tested its battery life with voice calls. On one occasion, I had a 1 hour long call and it battery was down from 100% to 90%. So that equates to probably a 10 hr continuous talktime with a full charge. Very clear speaker  
-Touching/Pointing is accurate  
-Sensitive screen  
  
Neutral:

-Battery Life (expected it to be better, still pretty decent though)  
-Rendering lag on certain websites that contain a lot of images  
-Screen resolution (Though the resolution isn't high, pixelation isn't obvious from viewing distance. Its not grainy and still very clear  
-Direct Call isn't always responsive. I think the camera doesn't see your ear always while you're messaging or in the contact list. It might take 1-2 more tries.  
-Screen contrast & brightness - Excellent indoors, good outdoors (without direct sun). Could have done better under direct sunlight ("By design" of AMOLED).  
  
Cons:

-"Actual" Free internal memory is about 4.5GB/8GB  
-Contains some bloatware that autostarts and clogs the system by Samsung & Other parties I'll list them below.  
-Minijack is a little soft with the volume.  
-MAJOR CONS: You can't put your apps on the SD card without rooting it.. Firmware limitation on Samsung's side most probably :(  
  
Bloatware in my opinion (These apps can autostart and they "revive" when you
attempt to kill them) They clog RAM, have a toll on the battery life as they
attempt to communicate with the internet or use the processor mainly.

To disable these services/apps -> Application Manager -> All -> Locate them ->
Uninstall updates/Disable -> Disable -> Restart your phone

1.SNS (Facebook integration stuff)

2.Street View

3.Samsung Account

4.S Voice (If you don't need a voice assistant)

5.Help

6.GTalk (You gotta be in the right context menu to sign out of GTalk/Gmail
Chat)

7.Google Search app (there's already a Chrome)

8.Google Plus

9.Samsung Chat On

10.Polaris viewer 4.1 (It keeps popping up the dialogue asking you to purchase
the pro version.. I disabled it and got adobe reader and a free office app)

11. Samsung's "Music Player" (Not a bloatware but its is quite clunky. "Google
Play Music", Google's Music player app from the play store's a lot more easier
to use and integrates better to the notification screen. Upon installation,
turn "3D effect" off if you don't want your music to sound like its from a
metal box.)

  
Conclusion:

This phone's great for my use. As an ex-iOS user, I found the Android OS to be
a lot less restrictive and apps were better integrated. Good call quality,
good reception.

  
Out-of-the-box experience was 3/5 imo largely due to high amounts of bloatware
that are turned on by default, if you tweaked these stuff by disabling them
you should be able to optimise RAM usage and increase your battery life by a
noticeable margin.

  
I bought a 16GB Micro SD for this phone because I thought apps would run on it
but unfortunately, no. I do hope this feature will be enabled via a software
update some time in the future.. because 4.5GB/8GB of unused NAND on the GS3
Mini's abit too low if you're a smartphone gamer (fortunately I'm not).

  
The biggest plus? Price. Absolutely great value and I am keeping this phone.

  
Overall, 4/5. :)

======================

If this info's helpful, mark it as a helpful post to allow others to get the
message. Honestly, I like Samsung hardware (look at my profile) but these are
the pros & cons I've identified. I do like this phone but it isn't perfect,
certain limitations listed above may be hated by some (SD card doesn't store
apps), a non-issue to others. If you could live with those limitations, I'm
pretty sure you'll love this phone.

  
======================

Just an additional note to anyone interested in this phone FOR the SERIOUS
buyers...

  
The Galaxy S3 Mini is NOT an officially sold product in the US, Samsung's
probably tired of the Apple litigation and they're not wanting to create any
circumstance that would create more accusations against them. To me, this is a
loss for fellow US consumers.

  
On the product itself... most likely the seller(s) would have acquired the
phone directly from Europe (probably the UK or Germany). This is a parallel
imported product.

1. Don't expect your manual or GS3Mini's "setup language" to be english. You
should've seen this coming.

2. As I've said in the review, network compatibility - your carrier's
frequency - don't complain if your phone does not call if you haven't made
this check.

3. IMPORTANT: Since the product is a parallel import, YOUR TRUST to YOUR
SELLER is KEY in this types of purchase. Consider the seller's:

-Reputation and seller review. Poor delivery, opened/used product etc in reviews  
-The reputation and track record is a good indicator if the seller's handled the GS3 and its packaging properly (Lower chances of DOA)  
-Assuming these 2 "factors" are considered, find out if the seller's item is "FULFILLED BY AMAZON" or the seller. You know what I'm talking about :) Amazon's extremely efficient shipment ETA.  
-If prices are *almost* the same between a "Fufilled by Amazon" vs a complete 3rd party, go for the Amazon. If the 3rd party's giving you a better deal in pricing, you probably should give the 3rd party a try. :)

**This review is from: Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III Mini Unlocked Android Smartphone - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)**

I had an S2 and loved it, then a nexus, also good, but both had poor battery
life and were too big (especially the nexus). The mini is the right size for a
phone you hold in your hand and talk on mostly, or send text, and occasionally
surf/use for google maps, etc. If you need a smart phone, and mostly use it as
a phone, this is it. Jelly Bean system, good graphics, enough power,
expandable memory. But, its not an S3, its an S3 mini, which means smaller
processor, not as fast with apps, etc. Battery lasts longer though, especially
if you put juice defender or something similar on it.

**This review is from: Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III Mini Unlocked Android Smartphone - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)**

The phone is nice, the screen is good, not astonishing as it's big brother
Samsung galaxy S3.

  
Is not a bad phone, but the thing here is the price. You can get an Optimus 2X
from LG, Nokia Lumia 900 maybe an iPhone 4. What I'm trying to say here and
don't take me wrong, it's not a bad phone at all, comes with Jeally bean,
camera is decent, screen is decent, but I consider it over priced. This phone
should be sold for $300 bucks or less and not $400

**This review is from: Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III Mini Unlocked Android Smartphone - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)**

Coming from a phone with a physical qwerty, I found this to be a big change.
The phone was light and slim, it also had a very bright and crisp screen. The
display of the regular S3 is better, but this phone more than meets my needs
as a not-compulsive cell phone user. I mainly text and send email,
occasionally use navigation and sometimes use the data like if I need store
hours or to find an ATM. First thing was to change the language as my phone
was international - but it was a breeze. It read my T-Mo SIM card with no
problems, synced up my contacts via gmail and them synched up my bookmarks via
chrome and danngggg I was on my way to being a Samsung fan.

  
Some notes: 1) this phone takes a standard SIM, not a micro one. 2) The three
buttons on the front are sensor lights. There is no indicator light. 3) Use
battery save mode and tone the screen down to a lower brightness to save
battery. Mine phone rarely goes down past 50% in any day when I do this. I
don't play games on my phone and I turn off most widgets that pull info like
the annoying weather one.

  
Overall, I really like this phone and as I use it more, I learn new things
like how to use blocking mode (how to block certain contacts and even at
certain times), how to manage apps and turn off energy wasters, and how to
arrange shortcuts on the screen the best way. I am a little behind on this
technology, but this phone has a sensor where it knows when you are looking at
the display and the phone won't auto dim on you if you are looking at it.
Pretty cool. Also, I have only used S-Voice a handful of times, but it has
been pretty accurate and I am amazed at all the little things this phone can
do.

  
Good little phone for small hands and although the price is a little steep, I
still like the phone a lot. I also had a gift card, so that helped! No
complaints.

**This review is from: Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III Mini Unlocked Android Smartphone - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)**

It is a great phone. Here are some highlights:

- It has a regular size SIM card, therefore no need to cut it. When you travel abroad usually you get a local regular size SIM and save on roaming.  
- it has a beautiful screen, just the right size. I wish Galaxy S3 had this screen because the one it has is way too big and can't be operated with one hand.  
- Battery life is impressive, with just the voice and WIFI turned on it managed to run close to 4 (four) days on one charge. You can see that complaining on short battery life is not productive at all since it is not just phone's fault. There are many factors that contribute to short battery life: wireless coverage in the area you live, whether you have all possible social gimmicks turned on that keep draining your battery, running apps in background that are poorly written and waste CPU cycles, amount of time the screen is on and so on.  
- Jelly Bean is easy flowing  
  
I am not a app junkie and mostly use the phone as a phone with occasional use
of apps when I am in WiFi hotspot range.

By achieving 4 days on a charge with no wireless data on, tells me how power
hungry 3G and wireless data can be, and multiplied by horrific cell coverage,
where instead of 5 towers we have just one, blasting at full power, we get
this sub par battery life on the smart-phones. I believe LTE should be worse
and drain you battery even faster, just in stand-by. Therefore we should blame
the carriers and not the phones in 98% of the cases.

Hope this review is helpful. I am happy with the phone and would recommend it
to my friends.

**This review is from: Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III Mini Unlocked Android Smartphone - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)**

The Samsung Galaxy S III mini was the perfect Christmas gift. It's small and
light, just what my wife wanted. I've found it to be every bit as powerful as
more expensive smart phones.

  
I'd recommend this phone to anyone interested in a small, light smart phone.

Very good phone still learning the many features that it provides. Had to go
online for a user manual as it does not contain one in the package. Better
features than the iPhone and its a great size especially for women

**Amazon Verified Purchase**([What's this?](http://www.amazon.com/gp/community-help/amazon-verified-purchase))

**This review is from: Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III Mini Unlocked Android Smartphone - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)**

The phone itself is great. I love that it is unlocked, came with the latest
Jelly Beans (4.1.1) software and after a month of use got an update to 4.1.2.
The phone is a perfect size, weight, and thickness. The battery life is pretty
good.

I'm on T-Mobile and it does not work with it well everywhere. I some areas of
Manhattan I can get really strong HSPA+ (4G) signal, in others I can barely
get EDGE.

It is not the fault of the phone, that's why 5 stars, but something that
people need to be aware of. The frequency that phone support is not really
compatible with what T-Mobile provides. Although when we went skiing all of my
friends with t-mobile phones did not have a signal and mine had 2 bars.

Overall I really happy with this phone.

The phone arrived in time and in excellent conditions. However, the item
description is inaccurate, this cell phone does not have NFC.

It appears that the NFC version is only available in the UK so far.

  
Thanks,

Juan Martin.

**This review is from: Samsung I8190 Galaxy S III Mini Unlocked Android Smartphone - White (Wireless Phone Accessory)**

The phone is just excellent.

Everything works smooth and there are not lags even when running games such as
jetpack joyride....

Altough hardware is less powerful than the big S3, Samsung did a greate job
with the Jelly Bean version to make it just as good

Battery life is excellent. Without enabling any of the power saving features
the phone lasts easily more than 24hrs

  
The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is the camera.

I will start with the bottom line, the pictures & videos are greate even on
your computer monitor. The problem is that there is a 1-2sec shutter lag due
to slow auto focus especially at low light conditions. I don't understand the
reason Samsung didn't put the same auto focus as in the big S3, where there is
zero auto focus lag... I hope it can be fixed in firmware, and that it will be
fixed in one of the near releases.
