This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
This phone is quite a bargain like Barrett said. It gives you a 1 Ghz processor, Android 4.0.4, and water resistance all in a light-weight package. The screen's resolution is mediocre, but its size makes it easy to carry in a pocket unlike larger "bling" phones. This is quite a step up from the Nokia E71 that I was using with another famous prepaid carrier.
