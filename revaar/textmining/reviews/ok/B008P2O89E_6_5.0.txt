5.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for a touch screen, September 19, 2012

Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)
This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
The water proof feature is what was the deciding factor on purchasing this phone, plus the low price.
I've dunked a couple phones in water before, totally ruining them & when I saw this one, it was ideal for me. Accidents do happen, so this is a just in case...
Eco mode is great to conserve battery space (without it I have to plug in at least 2 times or else battery will die fast) I text & facebook often throughout the day & have a few apps installed.
Sound quality on calls is great.
The screen has a nice resolution for a prepaid phone.
Music player installed (great bonus)
Headphone jack on top.
For some reason this phone has a better signal than my other Boost mobile phone did. (another great plus)
This phone really did exceed my expectations considering the low price & it being a prepaid phone (contract phones are usually nicer).
Honestly I do wish to have left my contract sooner (6 yrs being on contract with Sprint) and gone to Boost Mobile sooner! The monthly rates with Shrinkage are awesome & this phone is priced so well to be a great phone.
I am a text, social networking, sometimes calling, love the new technology person & I must say that I am happy with this phone.
My only complaint is the battery life is short for texting & social networking, otherwise it holds up well to phone calls (in eco mode)

Great phone. Price can't be beat. Love the fact that it didn't come with all the annoying apps pre installed that take up space.
