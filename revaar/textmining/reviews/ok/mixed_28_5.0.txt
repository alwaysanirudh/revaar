This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Nice slim black case. Upgraded from a Droid Incredible with a Verizon customer appreciation discount and caught the phone on sale. Also bought a 32gig SD card (suggested). The phone is amazing. Beautiful display; blazing fast. LOTS of features to catch up on. I keep the PDF Owners Manual on my desktop for occasional reading and tinkering. With a little tinkering with Battery Life and WiFi settings easily getting 1 1/2 to 2 days battery with moderate usage. Get one!
