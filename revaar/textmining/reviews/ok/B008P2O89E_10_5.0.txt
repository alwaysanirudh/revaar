This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
The great thing about this phone, it's waterproof . And yes, you can toss it into the beach and it works fine afterwards! it has Ice cream sandwich out the box! very cool the touch is really good and the colors aren't bad at all. I exchanged my Blackberry 9310 for it. The Blackberries app store is just limited no bank of america, amazon, or ebay it's crazy plus the letters on the blackberry were to small to read. This Hydro is awesome! I love it Back home with Android where I belong:).
