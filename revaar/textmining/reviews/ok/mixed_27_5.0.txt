This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I've had the Verizon flavor of this phone for about 2 months now. The phone is great. It was a major upgrade over my last phone the T-Mobile G2x (LG) and my work phone the Droid X2. I'd say my favorite feature improvement is the ability to add emergency numbers that the phone can call when it is locked. I like the idea of a paramedic knowing who to call if I were ever in a car accident. The phone is thin enough that putting the right case on it is no big deal, the phone will still fit easily in my pocket.

The Verizon security app bogged the phone down and didn't work well. I added McAffee WaveSecure and it seems to do a great job.

My only gripes are:
Google Wallet is only supported on the Sprint flavor
the apps menu scrolls side-to-side rather than up and down like my G2x and Droid X2.
