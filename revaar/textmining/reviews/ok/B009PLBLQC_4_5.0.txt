5.0 out of 5 stars **This phone is great!**, January 14, 2013


[Jay "The Middle-Aged



Samsung makes a great product. I really liked the feature sets of the SIII and
the Note II, but I really did not want a phone that large. The mini SIII has
some very similar specifications, though not as powerful, still the phone has
all the features I could need, and lives up to Samsung's quality. I've not had
a reset once since in two weeks since I started using it. The phones reaction
time is smooth, the access to Android features including Amazon Ap Store and
Google Play is easy, and the standard use of the mini usb charger allows
flexibility with other portable devices I currently use. If you are looking
for a tablet and phone all-in-one, consider the Note II or SIII, but if you
already have a great tablet, and need a well powered phone that works with all
the bells and whistles, this is a great product.
