my business is working outdoors. I'm always on the phone with my customers and guys, just talk and emails. no videos or gaming for me. I work in all types of weather. So I need a good phone. but at the same time I don't want a phone to cost lot because it just doesn't pay to replace it when it get wet or falls out of my pocket. The fact that it's water resistant is what I needed.

This is a good phone for the money but the Battery SUCKS I need to plug it in after just 5 hours of just talking and checking emails.

The ECO feature is cool and it is easy to navigate. overall its a okay phone....
