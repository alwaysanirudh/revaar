Stela Pen "Stela" (CO, USA) - See all my reviews
Amazon Verified Purchase(What's this?)
This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III Mini I8190 8GB Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 4.1 OS, Dual Core, Super AMOLED Touchscreen, 5MP Cam (Unlocked Phone)
I bought two of this phone (new). One of the phone I received was a open box with the seal violated/broken.
The second surprise inside of the bag where the phones were has a power adapter for the outlet (european to us). Both phones were european (I believe the written is german) and the adapter they sent was for the phone charger since european outlet is different from us.
Very disappointed, I returned both phones
Be careful when you buy a unlocked phone and check the seller
