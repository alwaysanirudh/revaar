1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous "stupid" phone, March 15, 2013

This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III Mini I8190 8GB Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 4.1 OS, Dual Core, Super AMOLED Touchscreen, 5MP Cam (Unlocked Phone)
My experience with this product has been a nightmare, from the beginning, without it having ever being dropped, exposed to water, anything. True, some of them are just the curse - yes, CURSE - of touchscreen (baby)technology, which is still quite lame compared to real buttons. And no, these are not "malfunctions," they are design flaws, period - I saw these same issues on other minis.
The following are the anti-features you can expect:
- a touch screen that often does not respond at the speed demanded - this creates a HUGE risk during driving, when a user has to avert his/her eyes to try, try, try, try, try to answer and activate the speaker (and end the call), especially as the screen repeatedly blacks out (for what? to save the pathetic battery power?) and canNOT be quickly revived. This is particularly fun when answering calls from clients, who do not expect to wait as this little piece of crap decides if and when its owner can answer it, or when dealing with automated systems that don't understand why it takes so long to press the directed key.
- the telephone shuts itself off without being touched, and even with a full battery
- the telephone cuts off the internet connection on a regular basis, without being touched, without a change in location, even in the middle of an online function during what a second ago had been an active connection. This did not happen to me with my previous telephones.
- press on the SMS button, frequently get the camera - repeatedly - until the mail decides to wake up
- try to send an SMS, and it tells you it failed even when it didn't, or that it was sent even when it failed; wait 4 days to get an important SMS
- try to send an SMS, and it hides the "create new mail" function for a few hours
- receive an SMS, and occasionally have to guess who sent it, while being thankful that at least it was designed to display the name/number of the sender
- press on the missed calls function, get the last person YOU called
- search for a number in your phone, Russian roulette if it comes up
- and of course, the battery drains very, very, very quickly when you use it for internet access
If you need your telephone to really function, try another company. Any suggestion that a more expensive phone is necessary is criminal, as the above issues have to do with very basic functions that should be expected at what is already quite a high price, given that the assemblers make less than minimum wage.
