4.0 out of 5 stars **Great little phone**, January 9, 2013





I needed a new phone and didn't want a contract so I went the unlocked
phone/month to month route. I wanted a Nexus 4 but couldn't for it to be
restocked. I did some looking around and this phone fit my needs. I live in an
American city with so coverage isn't an issue. I don't need my phone to be
anything more than a phone I can connect to the internet with as needed, as it
isn't my primary device for web activities. Needless to say the phone is
great. It's not an S3 but that's not what I wanted or needed. The phone has a
great aesthetic. It very slim and the curves are pleasing. The phone is light
in the hand but also feels well put together. I don't have huge hands so the
phone fits in my hand. The call quality is what I have to come expect living
in the city, which is pretty good quality as long as I am not underground or
in a building. The TouchWiz interface by Samsung works and doesn't feel like
it is cheapening my Android experience. I chose to use StraightTalk as my
phone service and the phone play s fine with the service as an ATT phone.
Also, I accidentally ordered a microsim as opposed to a regular sim card and
the slim fits in my phone just fine. Can't say others will but my microsim
from Straight talk works no issues. A friend had an extra regular sim he put
in my phone that we had a hard time removing. So far a great phone and I will
update if anything changes. Also, buy a protective case. The phone feels put
together but I am not sure how many drops it would survive.
