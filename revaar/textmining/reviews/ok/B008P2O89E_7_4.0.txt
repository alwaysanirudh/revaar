I agree with everything the first two reviewers mentioned. I got it just yesterday, but my first impressions are encouraging. I'm 31 now and realize I don't need a phone that I can play games on, don't need 4G, ect. This is a great little phone that does what I need it to: take calls, sent text messages, manage my email, and occasionally visit the web. Easy, simple, and best thing is the device is extremely inexpensive. And waterproof..?.. Forget about it, done deal. So far so good. Hope y'all enjoy it too...
