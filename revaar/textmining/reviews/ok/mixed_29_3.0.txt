This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Not a bad phone, but wish Verizon/Samsung would allow full use of it to the average unrooted user. I bought the 16 gb version (11 gb available for my use) and a 32gb SD card, but the external SD can only be used for storage of pictures, video or music files. Can't place or run any of your apps on the external SD. They also made it much more difficult to access the phone via your USB cable. On my previous (HTC EVO 4G ) phone I could access the SD card like an external disk drive and easily transfer files back and forth. This phone treats your external SD as an afterthought. The carrier and manufacturer are certainly making it more of a necessity for us non-geeks to explore rooting, although I understand that Jelly Bean 4.1.1 has made that a little more difficult, but that will change as the devs have more time to explore. I thought I had done enough due diligence prior to purchase and many of the other competing phones had their own issues
