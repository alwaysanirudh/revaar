4.0 out of 5 stars **Good but it does not have NFC**, February 25, 2013





The phone arrived in time and in excellent conditions. However, the item
description is inaccurate, this cell phone does not have NFC.

It appears that the NFC version is only available in the UK so far.

  
Thanks,

Juan Martin.
