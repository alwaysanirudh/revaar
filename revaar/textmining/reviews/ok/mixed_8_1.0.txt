1.0 out of 5 stars Yet another crazy 1 star rant, March 9, 2013

This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
I spend more time plugging this useless thing into a charger after finding it dead than I do making calls. If I spend time choosing the icons I want on the screen and my own wallpaper, then the pointless BoostZone software will replace my icons and wallpaper. There is no apparent way to disable this nonsense. I would list several more annoyances, but it's not helping my blood pressure.

I now understand why 1 star reviews often appear to be written by crazy folks. They've been driven that way by terrible products. This crazy person has thrown this "smart phone" across the room - not once, but several times since he owned it, and has finally decided to use it for a science project that involves a hacksaw.

In summary, I can't recommend buying it however cheap it appears.
