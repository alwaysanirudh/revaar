This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
Save your $ and headaches. Buyer beware. This phone does not work properly after a few weeks. It freezes up. It shuts down randomly. It fails to open apps. Check the phone's reviews on Boost Mobile website. You'll see a long list of people who are experiencing the same thing. Thank you, Amazon, for letting me return this faulty defective phone after three months. BTW, the problems started within a few weeks but over time have gotten progressively worse. I can hardly get my phone to work properly anymore. Requires pulling out the battery to reset.

DO NOT BUY!
