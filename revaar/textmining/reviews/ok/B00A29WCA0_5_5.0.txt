5.0 out of 5 stars **Galaxy S3 mini review**, March 5, 2013





It is a great phone. Here are some highlights:

- It has a regular size SIM card, therefore no need to cut it. When you travel abroad usually you get a local regular size SIM and save on roaming.  
- it has a beautiful screen, just the right size. I wish Galaxy S3 had this screen because the one it has is way too big and can't be operated with one hand.  
- Battery life is impressive, with just the voice and WIFI turned on it managed to run close to 4 (four) days on one charge. You can see that complaining on short battery life is not productive at all since it is not just phone's fault. There are many factors that contribute to short battery life: wireless coverage in the area you live, whether you have all possible social gimmicks turned on that keep draining your battery, running apps in background that are poorly written and waste CPU cycles, amount of time the screen is on and so on.  
- Jelly Bean is easy flowing  
  
I am not a app junkie and mostly use the phone as a phone with occasional use
of apps when I am in WiFi hotspot range.

By achieving 4 days on a charge with no wireless data on, tells me how power
hungry 3G and wireless data can be, and multiplied by horrific cell coverage,
where instead of 5 towers we have just one, blasting at full power, we get
this sub par battery life on the smart-phones. I believe LTE should be worse
and drain you battery even faster, just in stand-by. Therefore we should blame
the carriers and not the phones in 98% of the cases.

Hope this review is helpful. I am happy with the phone and would recommend it
to my friends.
