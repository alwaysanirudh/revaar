This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I have the Note I and wanted to mention something for those who are thinking about buying the Note II.

After almost a year, I wouldn't trade my Note for anything else but the Note II. Everytime I go into a store, I don't see anything else I would rather have.

People sometimes ask about the Note size, and I respond by telling them the device seems to get smaller and smaller each day. It's just that most ppl are used to a teeny tiny screen. It fits nicely into jean front pockets and my jean jacket shirt pockets.

The Note is more than a phone and with its size, it is actually usable without a magnifying glass. Videos, pics, e-mails, txt msg, games, etc are all very easy to use and see.

Dialing is a snap without fumbling on the keys. The audio is loud for playback. I hope Samsung does not take away the stylus since is very useful to make a quick note, pointer or drawing. I wished the Note One had the LED notification indicator like the Note II. So that is a selling point for me on the Note II.

The 8Meg camera takes the best pics and videos ever. I rarely use my still camera anymore. I just pull out the Note and use it for all pics.

We could go on forever talking about the Note and Note II. They just keep getting better. I'm running Android ICS on the Note One and it is great. I hear the Note II battery is very long lasting -> Li-ion 3,100mAh...
