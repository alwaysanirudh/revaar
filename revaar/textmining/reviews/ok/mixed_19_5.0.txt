This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I tested this phone against the iPhone 5, and Samsung GS3. I walked in to the Verizon store to upgrade my phone, with my mind made up about the iPhone 5. Before setting foot in the store, I'd never heard of the DNA. After an hour of testing a few phones, this was hands down the best phone I tested.

The screen is awesome, it covers the phone from corner to corner, taking full advantage of the size. Browsing the web using 4G is lightning fast, really responsive with very little lag. I've had the phone a week now, and really enjoy using it.
