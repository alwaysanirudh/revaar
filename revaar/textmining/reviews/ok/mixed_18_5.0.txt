This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
This phone is great. The screen is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. The size is perfect. It is a phone....not a phablet. The processor is out of this world. Incredibly snapping all around. The battery life is better than anyone could ask for. The combination of batter and processor do enough to get you through more than the day with normal use. The only negative is the storage. After the preloaded crap you have about 11 gb. This is plenty for standard apps and daily use. You can still fit photos/music on it but without being able to extend it you will need to monitor your use. Outside of that you will not find a more powerful and beautiful device.

I will happily tote this around until my next upgrade.(Was a bit sad losing unlimited data....but didn't really need it anyway.)
