This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
Switched to a smartphone about 2 months ago. First tried the Samsung Transform Ultra, then decided on the Kyocera Hydro for the lower price and Ice Cream Sandwich OS. Oops, Kyocera forgot to put in a proximity sensor on this phone. When you are talking on the phone the buttons get pressed causing muting, speakerphone, 3-way calling, ending your call. Extraordinarily ANNOYING!!! After contacting Kyocera (I did receive a prompt reply via email) tried adjusting the "safety" (weird nomenclature for this setting) and it's still way too sensitive to use as a phone. Everything else on the phone was fine, UNTIL yesterday. Now the on/off button is failing making the phone unusable (I've since read this seems to be somewhat common). It's really too bad, if it weren't for these two issues I'd think this phone was ok and now that I have everything set up the way I want it I have to start over. I may be done with purchasing this type of item from Amazon, too. Good for everything, EXCEPT making calls, if it lasts! I didn't test the waterproofness - but really manufactuere's should make all phones waterproof like this one as it looks like a simple silicone gasket is what seals the phone.

Also, does not scan barcodes, only QR codes.
