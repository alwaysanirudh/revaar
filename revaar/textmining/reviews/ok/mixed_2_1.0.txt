For being a cheap phone it has some great features. UNFORTUNATELY the Kyocera BUGS OUT all the time! Almost without fail, calls that go beyond 5 minutes (or sometimes less) will end with your caller going "Hello? Still there?", unable to hear you. IF you act fast enough, switching it to speakerphone will make you audible again, but often times it's too late and they've hung up. Shucks. Looks like you have to wait on hold AGAIN! Woh woh!

IF Kyocera fixes that, I will change my rating to a 5, but hopefully not another person buys this or any other Kyocera phone until that happens. Half-a$$ed BS like this should not be legal, let alone rewarded.
