4.0 out of 5 stars **Excellent smartphone**, January 4, 2013




The phone is just excellent.

Everything works smooth and there are not lags even when running games such as
jetpack joyride....

Altough hardware is less powerful than the big S3, Samsung did a greate job
with the Jelly Bean version to make it just as good

Battery life is excellent. Without enabling any of the power saving features
the phone lasts easily more than 24hrs

  
The only reason I didn't rate it 5 stars is the camera.

I will start with the bottom line, the pictures & videos are greate even on
your computer monitor. The problem is that there is a 1-2sec shutter lag due
to slow auto focus especially at low light conditions. I don't understand the
reason Samsung didn't put the same auto focus as in the big S3, where there is
zero auto focus lag... I hope it can be fixed in firmware, and that it will be
fixed in one of the near releases.
