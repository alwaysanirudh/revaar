5.0 out of 5 stars everything you'd want and (maybe) more than you need, January 6, 2013

I just bought this phone and it's really amazing. The instructions that come with it are minimal, so you may need to look up what certain functions do online... The s-pen is astoundingly practical, compared to what I imagined- a flimsy Blackberry stylus, and unintuitive screen. How wonderfully wrong I was! I downloaded Autodesk Sketchbook Mobile app and it really takes drawings to another level. I have an old 12" Wacom tablet, and this is as good as it ever was. I also have a Cintiq for work, but it's not quite at that level (in case you were wondering).

I think the main drawback is hidden options. You have to go through many a menu just to do anything.There are almost too many options as well like: how do you want your phone to vibrate when different people call you... there are 5+ options including a heartbeat, jingle bells, and the waltz- who needs that stuff? I'm happy when you can personalize ringtones to separate personal and professional calls.

Even though its length is approximately the length of a dollar bill, it's much lighter than it looks even with this big of a phone. I didn't have any trouble with the keyboard despite having broad fingers... there was more than enough space to hit the letters on the keypad with accuracy.

Great phone for $199!
