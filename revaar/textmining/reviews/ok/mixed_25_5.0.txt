This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III 4G Android Phone, Black 16GB (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
This phone is the best. It outperforms the iPhone every time. Although SVoice isn't the best, it has other features to make up for it. One thing I have been noticing is it overheating whenever I'm not using it. I recommend this phone to anyone, just go for the 32gb because 16gb fills up quickly.
