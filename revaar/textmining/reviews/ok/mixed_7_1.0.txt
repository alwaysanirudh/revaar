This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
I have had this phone for a couple of weeks now and I must say this phone sucks! It freezes up on me DAILY. I have to take the battery out and reboot the phone everyday. The apps take forever to load. The speech option rarely works and when it does work its never accurate. The navigation app locks my phone up every time I use it. I got this phone on Amazon (brand new) for $50 and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
