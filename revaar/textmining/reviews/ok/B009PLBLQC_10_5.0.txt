5.0 out of 5 stars **I really like this phone!**, February 5, 2013


(Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) - [See all my



Since I've had an i4s, and have used other phones before I rec'd this one, I
am not "gushing" about the phone, however, it is a great phone, and I'm having
no problems on the AT&T; network. Being an unlocked phone, I will probably see
about using it on T-mobile and Straight Talk as well.

  
It came w/a European plug, but an adapter was included for use here, and it
also came w/a USB cable for data and charging by computer or via USB charging
adapter, so no big deal. Set up was easy, however, if you purchase this phone,
make sure that your carrier gives you a data plan for a Smartphone, if you've
switched from an iPhone!

  
Got a great cover, screen protector, and I'm set! I noticed HDSPA show up in
areas where available, and otherwise, it automatically sets for whatever
signal your carrier provides. The built-in apps are a problem, because what
you don't want/need, you can't remove, but, not gonna obsess over that, cause
that's minor to me, and, other than having to get used to a different "look"
w/the camera, I have no regrets over selling my iPhone, and getting my Mini
Galaxy!

  
Really like this phone!
