This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
I researched pre-paid phones for about 2 months before I bit the bullet and made my purchase. I knew I wanted an android and I was torn between the Kyocera Rise and Hydro. I went with the Hydro purely because of Boost's shrinking monthly plans. After having the phone for 2 1/2 weeks I feel ready to share my opinion on how excited this phone makes me.

My biggest complaint about the Hydro is battery life purely because I'm always on the go, HOWEVER you must realize that any smartphone is always "thinking" checking your email, facebook, and everything else you have directly linked to it. So my solution was to keep a charger in my bag and I charge it when I'm at work and in the car.

It is surprisingly fast even on the network. The processor works quicker than I expected. The reviews on cnet said it was slow for the processor it had.

I haven't tested the water resistance yet purely because if it does happen I don't have proper insurance to back it up. I did get a 1 year best buy protection plan on it though for just in case.

All in all I have a great inexpensive phone that does everything I need without the hassle of a contract. I would gladly recommend this to any person.
