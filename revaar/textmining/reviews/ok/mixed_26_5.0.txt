Wow this baby is smoking hot!! I was originally getting the razr Maxx but thank goodness I didn't. The battery life on this lasts an entire day! I've been using it all day long & started out at only 87% at 7am. Now its at 32% & its 8pm & that's heavy use(3d games,hd movies & surfing). The screen is astonishing ..a big step up from my old Motorola phone of 2 years lol. Multitasking is a breeze. I've said enough. This has to be the best phone out right now.
