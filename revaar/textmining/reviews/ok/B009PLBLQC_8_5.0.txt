5.0 out of 5 stars **Has everything I could expect**, March 4, 2013





The Samsung S3 Mini offers everything I needed or wanted from a phone. The
phone has Jelly Bean preinstalled, S-Voice, and plenty of other apps and
widgets to get you started as soon as you unbox it. As far as the battery is
concerned, I haven't had any problems with a charge lasting all day but that
depends on the person. I would say I am a moderate user, I keep the GPS turned
off when not in use and use the power saving features. If the battery is not
large enough for you, there are extended capacity batteries, external backup
phone cases or external battery banks.

The Kies program available for download from Samsung is very user friendly for
transferring files from an old phone or syncing files with a computer. The
manual packaged with the phone was not in English but is available from
Samsung's website as a PDF. The downloaded manual is VERY easy to understand,
with step by step instructions and illustrations.

I am using this phone on Straight Talk, with an AT&T; SIM card and had no
problems getting it set up. As far as Data connection, I am usually on Wi-Fi
but have used it with HSDPA, Edge, and 3G.
