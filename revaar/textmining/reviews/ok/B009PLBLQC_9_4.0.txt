4.0 out of 5 stars **So far I like it.**, February 21, 2013






Purchased this phone about two weeks ago. It came new with American plug
outlet adapter. Downloaded Galaxy s III manual PDF from internet, also there
is manual in English in the phone widgets. Took me a while to figure out all
settings and apps, camera and video, managed to download all my contacts from
old phone using SD card.

Uploaded Skype - it worked fine during driving on desert highway.

T mobile works fine with their SIM card, showing E, 3G or H connection or no
connection at the same spot during a minute. Regular calls are fine so far.

Battery works fine and stays all day during playing games, calling, messaging,
internet browsing and using camera. The phone itself is small and thin and
light, screen is nice and bright.

This is my first android smart phone and I like it. :)
