5.0 out of 5 stars **Samsung Galaxy S3 Mini**, March 18, 2013





The phone itself is great. I love that it is unlocked, came with the latest
Jelly Beans (4.1.1) software and after a month of use got an update to 4.1.2.
The phone is a perfect size, weight, and thickness. The battery life is pretty
good.

I'm on T-Mobile and it does not work with it well everywhere. I some areas of
Manhattan I can get really strong HSPA+ (4G) signal, in others I can barely
get EDGE.

It is not the fault of the phone, that's why 5 stars, but something that
people need to be aware of. The frequency that phone support is not really
compatible with what T-Mobile provides. Although when we went skiing all of my
friends with t-mobile phones did not have a signal and mine had 2 bars.

Overall I really happy with this phone.
