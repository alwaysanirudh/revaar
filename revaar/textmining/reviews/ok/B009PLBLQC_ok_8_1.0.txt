This review is from: Samsung Galaxy S III Mini I8190 8GB Unlocked GSM Phone with Android 4.1 OS, Dual Core, Super AMOLED Touchscreen, 5MP Cam (Unlocked Phone)
The Samsung Galaxy S3 is a horribly made phone. After the second week of owning this phone the screen shattered after falling on my carpet matt floor. A couple months later the phone would not hold a charge more than and hour. I had to buy a new charger because the one that came with the phone stopped working. Last week the phone stopped charging completely. After reading many reviews about the phone needing the charging port replaced by THOUSANDS of different owners of this phone I contacted customer service. Since the screen shattered they would not replace the charging port even though it is obviously a manufacturing error. This company is horrible a phone purchased at $500 they will not even repair. Horrible product cheaply made horrible customer service not willing to admit fault with their own product even though it is well documented all over the internet. Not to mention all the bugs the phone has.
