1.0 out of 5 stars Overheats, freezes, & horrible battery life., September 19, 2012

This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
I dropped Sprint and switched to Boost Mobile, going from an HTC EVO 4G to the new Kyocera Hydro. Next time, I think I'll shoot myself. The phone overheats, freezes, and even running Task Killer will go through half the battery in less than four hours without even using the phone! The camera is atrocious, the screen resolution is poor, and the charger port cover is flimsy and tedious to get open. The phone doesn't have speed dial numbers, but shortcuts instead.

Boost offers NO warranty on the phone. Bringing it back three days after I bought it I was told I should have added the five dollars a month insurance (with a $65.00 deductible on a $130.00 POS phone)!

I may save some money with Boost, but I won't be doing it with this phone.
