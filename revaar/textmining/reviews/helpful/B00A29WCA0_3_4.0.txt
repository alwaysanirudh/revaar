4.0 out of 5 stars **Nice, but not very impressed**, December 7, 2012


[Daniel Garcia Hidalgo



The phone is nice, the screen is good, not astonishing as it's big brother
Samsung galaxy S3.

  
Is not a bad phone, but the thing here is the price. You can get an Optimus 2X
from LG, Nokia Lumia 900 maybe an iPhone 4. What I'm trying to say here and
don't take me wrong, it's not a bad phone at all, comes with Jeally bean,
camera is decent, screen is decent, but I consider it over priced. This phone
should be sold for $300 bucks or less and not $400
