4.0 out of 5 stars **Affordable GS3 in a smaller form factor!**, January 25,
2013





==UPDATE 3 Mar '13=== A Titan Grey version of the Galaxy S III Mini i8190 is
also available with some of the very same Amazon sellers now!

  
So I bought this phone to replace an iPhone 4. Been having it for 2 years and
the antennagate issue's been getting worse especially this year... So I
thought I'd make a small phone upgrade and I got the S3 Mini.

  
My thoughts on this phone after using it for 2 months.

  
BEWARE: Before buying this phone, CHECK YOUR MOBILE CARRIER'S NETWORK
BROADCASTING FREQUENCY BEFORE BUYING THIS PHONE, THIS IS A POTENTIAL
INCOMPATIBILITY IF YOU HAVEN'T CHECKED.

==================================================================

  
Pros:

-Very light for its size, isn't too big  
-3.5G is pretty fast (Btw the power saver feature can throttle your bandwidth aka internet "speed" apart from the processor)  
-Android 4.1 preloaded  
-Very smooth UI  
-Still has the good multitasking feature on GS3  
-(Call Quality) So I tested its battery life with voice calls. On one occasion, I had a 1 hour long call and it battery was down from 100% to 90%. So that equates to probably a 10 hr continuous talktime with a full charge. Very clear speaker  
-Touching/Pointing is accurate  
-Sensitive screen  
  
Neutral:

-Battery Life (expected it to be better, still pretty decent though)  
-Rendering lag on certain websites that contain a lot of images  
-Screen resolution (Though the resolution isn't high, pixelation isn't obvious from viewing distance. Its not grainy and still very clear  
-Direct Call isn't always responsive. I think the camera doesn't see your ear always while you're messaging or in the contact list. It might take 1-2 more tries.  
-Screen contrast & brightness - Excellent indoors, good outdoors (without direct sun). Could have done better under direct sunlight ("By design" of AMOLED).  
  
Cons:

-"Actual" Free internal memory is about 4.5GB/8GB  
-Contains some bloatware that autostarts and clogs the system by Samsung & Other parties I'll list them below.  
-Minijack is a little soft with the volume.  
-MAJOR CONS: You can't put your apps on the SD card without rooting it.. Firmware limitation on Samsung's side most probably :(  
  
Bloatware in my opinion (These apps can autostart and they "revive" when you
attempt to kill them) They clog RAM, have a toll on the battery life as they
attempt to communicate with the internet or use the processor mainly.

To disable these services/apps -> Application Manager -> All -> Locate them ->
Uninstall updates/Disable -> Disable -> Restart your phone

1.SNS (Facebook integration stuff)

2.Street View

3.Samsung Account

4.S Voice (If you don't need a voice assistant)

5.Help

6.GTalk (You gotta be in the right context menu to sign out of GTalk/Gmail
Chat)

7.Google Search app (there's already a Chrome)

8.Google Plus

9.Samsung Chat On

10.Polaris viewer 4.1 (It keeps popping up the dialogue asking you to purchase
the pro version.. I disabled it and got adobe reader and a free office app)

11. Samsung's "Music Player" (Not a bloatware but its is quite clunky. "Google
Play Music", Google's Music player app from the play store's a lot more easier
to use and integrates better to the notification screen. Upon installation,
turn "3D effect" off if you don't want your music to sound like its from a
metal box.)

  
Conclusion:

This phone's great for my use. As an ex-iOS user, I found the Android OS to be
a lot less restrictive and apps were better integrated. Good call quality,
good reception.

  
Out-of-the-box experience was 3/5 imo largely due to high amounts of bloatware
that are turned on by default, if you tweaked these stuff by disabling them
you should be able to optimise RAM usage and increase your battery life by a
noticeable margin.

  
I bought a 16GB Micro SD for this phone because I thought apps would run on it
but unfortunately, no. I do hope this feature will be enabled via a software
update some time in the future.. because 4.5GB/8GB of unused NAND on the GS3
Mini's abit too low if you're a smartphone gamer (fortunately I'm not).

  
The biggest plus? Price. Absolutely great value and I am keeping this phone.

  
Overall, 4/5. :)

======================

If this info's helpful, mark it as a helpful post to allow others to get the
message. Honestly, I like Samsung hardware (look at my profile) but these are
the pros & cons I've identified. I do like this phone but it isn't perfect,
certain limitations listed above may be hated by some (SD card doesn't store
apps), a non-issue to others. If you could live with those limitations, I'm
pretty sure you'll love this phone.

  
======================

Just an additional note to anyone interested in this phone FOR the SERIOUS
buyers...

  
The Galaxy S3 Mini is NOT an officially sold product in the US, Samsung's
probably tired of the Apple litigation and they're not wanting to create any
circumstance that would create more accusations against them. To me, this is a
loss for fellow US consumers.

  
On the product itself... most likely the seller(s) would have acquired the
phone directly from Europe (probably the UK or Germany). This is a parallel
imported product.

1. Don't expect your manual or GS3Mini's "setup language" to be english. You
should've seen this coming.

2. As I've said in the review, network compatibility - your carrier's
frequency - don't complain if your phone does not call if you haven't made
this check.

3. IMPORTANT: Since the product is a parallel import, YOUR TRUST to YOUR
SELLER is KEY in this types of purchase. Consider the seller's:

-Reputation and seller review. Poor delivery, opened/used product etc in reviews  
-The reputation and track record is a good indicator if the seller's handled the GS3 and its packaging properly (Lower chances of DOA)  
-Assuming these 2 "factors" are considered, find out if the seller's item is "FULFILLED BY AMAZON" or the seller. You know what I'm talking about :) Amazon's extremely efficient shipment ETA.  
-If prices are *almost* the same between a "Fufilled by Amazon" vs a complete 3rd party, go for the Amazon. If the 3rd party's giving you a better deal in pricing, you probably should give the 3rd party a try. :)
