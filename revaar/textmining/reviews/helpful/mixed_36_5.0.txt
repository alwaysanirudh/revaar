This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
With Galaxy Note II and Smart Dock you no longer need a tablet, portable game console, home game console, media streamer, laptop/desktop PC, notepad and pen, etc. This device has the power, versatility and features to do it all with industry leading battery life while still fitting in your pants pocket. This is the future of mobility.
