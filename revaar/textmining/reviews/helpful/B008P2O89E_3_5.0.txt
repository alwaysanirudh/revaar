This review is from: Kyocera Hydro Prepaid Android Phone (Boost Mobile) (Wireless Phone Accessory)
I bought this for my wife who was using a non smart phone from Boost. I already have been using a Samsung Galaxy Prevail for the past year so I thought I would try out the Kyocera for her. I can saw wow to this phone in comparison to my prevail! The storage has tons compared to my Prevail, it flies, has a bigger screen and is water resistant! I bought her a purple plastic and rubber protective case on Amazon and it looks nice. I like this phone so much, I bought one and it is on the way! I got it on sale for $99 and I will be retiring the Galaxy Prevail! I am not a smart phone guru by any means and all I have to compare it to is my Samsung and there is no comparison! I really like the Ice Cream Sandwich and am blown away by how voice mail is transferred to text so no more calling, entering stuff and going through call after call. I can't put it down! Every app that I have on my Galaxy runs way way faster on the Kyocera! THUMBS UP!
