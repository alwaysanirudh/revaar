This review is from: HTC DROID DNA 4G Android Phone (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
Have had the Droid DNA since launch day, and this phone is the absolute best.

The battery exceeds my expectations, getting through a full day is no problem for me using web, email, text, google talk, streaming music via BT, checking weather, reading Kindle, you name it. Average 12 hours or so battery for me with 20% or so remaining at the time I plug it in at night.

This phone takes full advantage of the Verizon network unlike the Verizon Samsung GNEX and S3 I just got rid of. Samsung has very poor RF performance compared to this HTC. I now have rock solid LTE where the Sammy's would constantly be searching for a signal, and often requiring a reboot to reconnect.

The Verizon bloatware - Disable it. go to settings, apps, click the app and press DISABLE. Bam, gone!

Google now - a huge battery drain, disable it. If you need traffic or calendar reminders open the appropriate app. Google now is constantly reading calendar, gps, using data, who knows what else. Disable it and enjoy a 25% or so battery boost.

The screen! The screen is gorgeous and very fluid. The only app I have found a problem using the screen is the built in web browser. There is some minor vertical tearing, where one half of the screen will update faster than the other when scrolling. No biggie as video and flash works great. Fun fact - this screen is about the size of an iPhone 4, the whole phone!

I love this phone, get it. Rip off the stupid rubber charging port cover, and get the Diztronic case as it fits perfect and matches the phone color and texture perfectly.
