5.0 out of 5 stars **I love it! (english/spanish review)**, January 9, 2013





Hi guys,

I must admit that I when I purchased this mobile, I was a little afraid. I had
read lots of reviews and watched some videos on YouTube before the purchase.
Anyway, I was worried mainly because of the screen resolution (480 x 800, that
means no HD), the battery life and the size of the screen.

  
I can tell you, this mobile is just awesome! It comes with Android 4.1.1 Jelly
Bean installed, which is so beautiful and fluid. The screen is great, battery
life is very good and the size of the screen is, in my opinion, perfect. I've
never considered the "regular" Samsung Galaxy S3 because it is way to big for
me. I wanted something quite small (although the screen is bigger than an iPod
touch 4th gen), responsible, attractive and efective. This mobile is excellent
for me! :-).

  
The mobile accept 3G, it has smart stay, and all those "high-tech" features
like his bigger brother the S3.

I will reply any question you might have about this device and update this
review next saturday.
