This review is from: Samsung Galaxy Note II 4G Android Phone, Titanium Gray (Verizon Wireless) (Wireless Phone)
I really am loving this device. More than I thought I would. The screen is beautiful and big, fast, smooth, and bright. Very little downside for me.

PROS:
--Bright Screen

--Fringer Print coating - I haven't heard anybody talk about the coating on the screen, but it is one of my favorite feature! It is like working on silk, and it doesn't pick up finger print even close to what my previous phones did. REally has a luxury feel.

--Battery life - HUGE factor for me. I can get through a regular moderate use day, and still have 30-40% batter when I get home. CRAZY GOOD! This can even be improved with tighter control over the settings for sure.

--Removable battery - AND if the giant 3100mAh batter isn't enough, you can swap it out!

--Speed - FAST FAST FAST!

--SD card slot - up to 64BG on top of the 16GB on board

--Android 4.1 Jelly Bean - I think they have finally passed iOS with this version. Super fast smooth, and TON of cool gesture features available.

--LED light on the front is great for notification without having to turn on the phone

--Home Button - At 1st I didn't like it, but with such a big phone, it is really handy to beable to wake it up with the home button, and not have to reach up the side

--Design- much improved over the Note I - thinner, buttons are more reachable. Very premium feel, even though it is all plastic. I'm surprised how much I like it.

--Camera - lots of cool features and effects, and it is SUPER FAST

--Touch Wiz - lots that I'm not a huge fan of, but the lock screen widgets are great. Otherwise, I switched to Nova Launcher, and LOVE IT! This really sold the device for me. Touch wiz isn't great, but not horrible either. Nova Launcher erases most of the annoyance for me (including having to look at Verizon Bloat ware in the app drawer) - SO EASY TO CUSTOMIZE!

--S-PEN - I almost forgot! Very easy to use, needs more apps, but the ones that work well are beautiful. It writes almost better than a regular pen.

--Phone - volume on the speaker and ear piece are fine. Very load and clear.

LOVE THIS PHONE!

CONS

--Touch Wiz - The settings are scattered all over, some in the settings, some in the individual apps. More centralized would be better. customized notification bar is so-so. Wish I could re-arrange the icons and shrink them. Pure JellyBean is much better (ESPECIALLY on 4.2).

--Size - NOT A CON for me! I used my old iphone last night and it felt like a tiny little toy. Almost unusable. I love the giant screen, but if you have small hands it will probalby be too big. I'm 6" with large hands, but it is easier to drop...

--Very Slick - I had to get a case because it is so smooth and slippery. Very easy to drop. I found a decent bumper case that isn't too bulky, and adds enough grip to feel more comfortable.

Anything else..... NOT REALLY! Android apps aren't always the best available, but the level of customization is so huge, It is worth breaking out of the Apple and Microsoft walled gardens. (Yes, I said Microsoft too! - just spend two years with WP7, and it is just as closed as apple...IMO)
