4.0 out of 5 stars **s3 mini**, December 19, 2012


[Justin W. Bancroft



I had an S2 and loved it, then a nexus, also good, but both had poor battery
life and were too big (especially the nexus). The mini is the right size for a
phone you hold in your hand and talk on mostly, or send text, and occasionally
surf/use for google maps, etc. If you need a smart phone, and mostly use it as
a phone, this is it. Jelly Bean system, good graphics, enough power,
expandable memory. But, its not an S3, its an S3 mini, which means smaller
processor, not as fast with apps, etc. Battery lasts longer though, especially
if you put juice defender or something similar on it.
