Recieved mine 2 days ago and I am totally jazzed.

Its got more than what Id expect in a $129 phone: ICS, 1ghz, and the screen reads well in daylight. Its light, travels easy in the pocket & does the web well.

Now the waterproof thing is really cool. Drop it in water, dunk it, leave it. It totally works & goes against all my mental training over the past 10 years on how to treat a phone. The touchscreen is suprisingly responsive when wet (not perfect) but I can see myself trying underwater video this weekend. And Im stoked I dont have to have a big bulky phone to get waterproofed as Ive seen before.

Well done.
