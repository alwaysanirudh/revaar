"Believe the other reviews, folks.  I ordered this joystick solely on the reviews here on Amazon and I am glad that I did.  I don't want to reiterate too much of what the other reviewers have already said, but I will say what I think is important.  I only use Microsoft Flight Simulator 2004 and this joystick worked with the game right out of the box!  The quick start guide explains which buttons are mapped to which functions by default for Flight Simulator X.  Turns out the same mapping applies to FS 2004 as well!"

"The Thrustmaster T Flight Hotas X gives the user exacting control over every type of aircraft.  I used to be a real pilot but because of medical problems I can never fly again because the pressure changes of altitude will kill me.  The Thrustmaster T Flight Hotas X, attached to my newest computer with an Athlon II X2 235e 2.7GHz Processor and 6GB Ram has given me back the ability to fly the aircraft I used to plus many others I always wanted to try.  Coupled with the new Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition which I purchased through Amazon.com when I bought The Thrustmaster T Flight Hotas X allows me to get back in the air with such reality that sometimes I forget I am sitting at a computer in my office."
"THE T-FLIGHT HOTAS STICK FOR PC/PS3 ( is well worth every penny that i spent for it.  you can control the tension by twisting the knob on the bottom .  and you can Seperate the throttle from your flight stick !  it's as though i have my very own flight simulator .  so go out and purchase this item if you enjoy flight games,  you wont be disappointed i guarantee that !!!"
"I'm a newbie gamer and have only used this this thing a few times, but I can say that it is well built and functions flawlessly as far as I can tell. It's a lot bigger than I was expecting."

"Let me start off by saying 2 things that I feel are relevant to this review. First, I am not a 'serious' flight simmer, but I have been playing flight sims for about 10 years. To me, the main things that separate me from the REAL serious simmers are time, and more importantly.. money. Second, I have been looking to replace my old MS Force Feedback 2 joystick, which I absolutely loved. Unfortunately, MS in their infinite (sarcasm intended) wisdom, do not, and will not update drivers for Windows Vista and/or Windows 7. I am currently using the TM on my Windows 7 64bit machine. One other note, this is NOT a force feedback stick."
This is a must have for flight enthusist's and gamers. While you could get better quality with something like the Saitek X52(Pro). It does have about a ten degree deadzone on the joystick so extremely slight movements won't affect anything. It's still over all a good joystick with a nice HOTAS feature(full sized seperatable throttle) with tool included. So if your on a budget this is the best you can get for the price!

When using this Thrustmaster product w/ Flightsim one immediately discovers that the throttle and joystick are not fine precision instruments. The lack of precise control takes away from enjoying the game. To bad. It looks good.Just doesn't perform to my expectations.

This is a great flight stick. I use it for FSX and Aces High. If you are like me and are always looking to get a good quality product for the least money and read endless reviews. Stop. For a budget priced stick it does everything.
I purchased the Thrustmaster T Flight Hotas X to pilot my MS Flight Simulator X Gold Edition & it works great!  After reading reviews on other products I settled on this & I concur with all the other positive reviews.  I am a 72 year old grandpa with an old pilots license which I haven't used in 20 years.  I use it on my new high powered laptop & separate the thruster & joy stick on each side of the laptop on a simple platform just high enough for my legs to go under & it works very functionally.
"The controller is amazing, works great & helps a lot with flight games (IL-2, Hawx ECT). I do have to switch it to controller 1 every time it seems I start a game (very minor thing). Also after a couple months of using this controller it seems after an hour or two of use it starts acting weird - game randomly stops recognizing controller until I unplug it & plug it back in a few times, or game will start reading movements that were not made on the controller, now this being said it has happened mainly on IL-2, sometimes in Hawx, so I cannot be sure this is the controllers fault, it may have something to do with the PS3 or games, also it could just be the one defective controller but I did think it was worth mentioning."
"I had used a Saitek Cyborg X controller for a little more than a year. I bought it because of the dual throttle control. This unit is of course made for a single engine, so only one throttle control. I have also used several other flight sticks, and had some small issues with all of them."

"Just have to say it's awesome! I bought this Item to play Battel Field 3. I purchased this game because people told me they have aircraft you get to fly. Well after trying the PS3 original controller I was crashing heli and other aircrafts like they were going out of style. I never play battle Field before still learning the game. After trying this Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas X Joystick with Detachable Throttle Control (PS3/PC), what a difference is like day and night. I am a top gun now with just a 3 hrs of play,it takes time adapting to the buttons but I like how easy it flies the helis smooth and easy, no crashes for me and the tanks love this system too. Easy to set up just take your time getting used to it."

"This is an awesome joystick, since i bough it been using it in FS2004, no really much configuration to do works perfect, FSX even better, on my PS3 works great been using it in HAW X, IL-2 and works great, y really recommend this joystick, very affordable and for the price its just amazing..."
Great joystick at a very good price but the manual is poorley written with alot of information left out. It's left up to you to figure out.  The SE and SC buttons are not explained fully only referred to as number 12 and ???. Mapping and preset buttons are touched on lightly.

"Review BY: Gary G. Brown: This stick and throttle combo is about 12"" L x 6"" W. It has plenty of buttons to customize functionality. The throttle and stick can be seperated or screwed together. I've had no problems using it with MicroSoft Flight Sim X. It has non-slip tabs on the bottom which I like."
"My budget was limited, so after shopping around I settled for this HOTAS."
"I bought this for my husband and son for use with two different PS3 games (Hawx & IL-2 Sturmovik).  It works wonderfully.  I couldn't be more pleased.  We haven't yet tried it with the PC, but I don't anticipate any problems.  I do recommend this product to anyone."
"This is the first joystick I bought and was mainly attracted to it because of the reasonable price it maintained while including a throttle control. The first (and only ) game I tried it on was HAWX and once I crashed into the ground more than my share of times, I was finally used to the stick and started to have a blast. Going into cockpit view and slamming around the throttle and twisting and pushing the stick feels so natural. I didn't have any interest in flight sims before, but I now want to play them just to use this amazing controller. it does not feel at all cheap and it doesn't feel like anything is going to break even if you slam any of the components against their maximum range of movement.  If you want a great flight stick for the price, buy this right now and don't even read the rest of the review."
