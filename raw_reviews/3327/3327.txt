LAMENTO DECIR QUE MI EXPERIENCIA CON ESTE VENDEDOR FUE MUY MALA. Pésimo producto. Recibí teléfono bloqueado.Solamente en idioma inglés generó gastos extras (Venezuela).Sus sellos estaban violentados. PARECÍA REPARADO PREVIAMENTE.
"Want a refund!  Purchased on January 9th of the year and as of  as of March 12 it refused to take a charge and is at this time totally inoperable.I liked the phone, but for $200 plus dollars it should have worked longer than 2 months.  Tried to do a hard reset as shown on the web , but nothing worked. BEWARE OF 30 DAY WARRANTIES.  Because my $200.00 phone decided to die in 62 days I am entitled to no help or suggestions from the seller Surge Telecom and Amazon cannot help either. Oh, well."
"be careful with these people, they send send defective products, customer service is terrible I lost all my money, they are scammers."
EL ARTICULO ESTA EN EXCELENTES CONDICIONES .
The phone seemed to be used. it did not charge. the phone was bought in the US to be used in Venezuela. It's more expensive to send it to USA than fix it. I took it to technical support and i was told that the phone had been opened before. Also i was told that i had been wet and i had to payed 90 dollars for it to be fixed. The motherboard had to be replaced and it was wet. This has been the worst buyment of my life.
Muy bueno el telef me salio de lo mejor y me agarra 3G para movilnet en venezuela good good good...

"received the computer without battery, without headphones apart the phone is not released and is a problem to use the networks, I use the phone only to take pictures and alarm, it's a shame that after I trust you to be the hit, I demand a solution"
"BECAUSE THE CELL PHONE HAD BEEN MANIPULATED , IT NEVER ACCEPTED MY SIM CARD , DESPITE THE FACT THAT IT WAS UNLOCKED . I DID NOT RATE IT BEFORE  BECAUSE I RECEIVED THE ITEM YESTERDAY BECAUSE I LIVE IN VENEZUELA"
When i received the phone I realized that some parts where a little loose. Then I tried to charge it and it didn't charge well I had to take the battery out and put it back in so it could charge properly and I have to do this every time I want to charge it. And the last thing is that the phone does not pick 3G signal never. So I was a little disappointed
