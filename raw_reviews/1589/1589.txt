"I rarely write reviews, but this product deserves a mention.  I think we can all agree it's an excellent product and serves its purpose very well.  But I just want to add, I had this item shipped to me during deployment.  A lot of times, our mail arrives with bumps, scrapes, etc.  It is packed onto large pallets and airlifted to our ship and it can take over a month at times to get a piece of mail.  I was worried that the item would arrive with scratches or a broken screen.  I have to say, that Amazon packed it very well and the packaging used by GAEMS was fantastic.  I am sure my box got dropped, kicked, thrown or worse.  The outside was beat up pretty bad.  But the packaging surrounding the unit was superb and it looked like I just picked it up in the store and carefully took it home in my car.  Wonderful.  I played HALO for several hours last night on it and it was heavenly.  Thank you so much for not just a great product GAEMS and AMAZON, but for making sure it arrives to anywhere in the world in mint condition. AAAA+++++"

"What can I say - started this 3 different times. Vanguard picture, sound, construction far more than I expected. I have two  cases of the G155 for i.m an otr driver and uses these in my truck / truckstops etc.  Tne vanguard picture so clear at any angle with huge sound improvements over the g155 model.  I had this sitting around the house and was planning to return it but had to try it out with all the great reviews.  Buy this my Amazon cousins before the spec edit is gone,... wish I had the words but so excited  and my kids laughing at me for being so excited. Not the normal grandpa - been a big gamer since my first 199.00 atari 2600 and Gaems  have made a statement - and yes after two returned cracked halo consoles - I found one  at another store and  looking forward to pop the star wars console out for the cortana  transparent one.  Later folks"

"My son in law just broke his ankle so is not working and my daughter is an full time student, they are very short of money and are not going to have an Christmas , so I knew that he wanted this really bad so I got it. I gave it to him when it arrived on the 17th of December he was so happy he started to cry It made me feel so good that I was able to get this for him. The thing is really COOL. Love the screen it great."

"First off id like to start by saying WOW....always wanted to buy the g155 but then saw that this bad boy came out and had to get it...I am currently deployed and have LOVED this! great way to kill time on night shift(lol) and any free time u get. I did my research and GAEMS seems to be a great company thinking about they're gamers and have a GREAT return policy..just incase you didnt do the research like myself if you get this with any dead pixels you can get it replaced no problem. Mine came in right before i left and the packing was great, no room to move and well protected. I WOULD recommend this to any on the go gamer and for any fellow brother or sister in arms that are deployed!"
"This is an incredible product! Great big bright screen! Yes...this is being played in a deployed location in Afghanistan. Everyday after I am relieved I give it a two-four hour run. I am not worried about dust because the self-containing case, I leave my 360, two controllers and several games inside of it and I do not fear for one second carrying it. This would make a great gift even if someone is not into interactive entertainment...maybe someone who enjoys tv shows or movies but is always on the go. I only had one concern as I opened this product and placed my 360 inside, will the disc tray crash into the frame? Nope. It glides right over it. The straps hold the 360 steady. I await future iterations for the next gen consoles so I can buy some for family members with great grades!"
"I did not buy this product on Amazon, mostly because I wanted it badly and did not want to wait. I purchased it at the Microsoft Store in my local mall."

"Travel much?  This is your one stop shop.  Room for console, controllers, and cables.  Screen resolution only runs at 720P ~ but you do not even really notice it.  Sounds quality is 120% of what I had expected.  They spent allot of time and love to ensure the sound quality was #1.  Dual head phone jacks was a GREAT addition."
""
I originally was hesitant to purchase this item as I wanted only 1080p devices. I voiced my questions on a forum and like many others a member of the company chose to engage and explain their reasoning for why the resolution used was chosen. I was still not sold.  Then I saw the reviews coming in from buyers and the near unanimous positive views and and decided to take the plunge.

"Brought this on vacation - Xbox on the go - very nice! Also worked well with any device that works over HDMI. Used it as a second display for my laptop and viewed a few videos off my camcorder. Not too heavy, well built, big ol' screen - I'm glad I selected this over the Sentry."
I'm in the military and constantly traveling.  I am deployed at this time and this is perfect.  This fits all my needs.  Screen is clear and crisp and the accent lights are a cool touch.
"Finally a solution, to the classic ""how can I carry my home console around?"" conundrum. If your a fan of Xbox and halo this (for lack of a better term) ""briefcase"" does it in style. It big, which it to be expected, since its made to house an Xbox (the non-halo edition of this ""vanguard"" model fits a ps3 as well) all your cords an has a TV built into it. It can also get a little heavy with everything in there, so be prepared for that. There are only a couple concerns I have with it."

"After dealing with the very friendly customer service at GAEMS, and receiving a new unit to replace the previous one, my review had to change. All of the original praise I gave it, about its concept, design, and function was understated. This unit is top-notch for gaming. The non-reflective screen, excellent speakers (especially for how small they are!) and awesome blue lights (everybody likes fancy lights) really make this an experience."
I use it for my HALO 4 Xbox 360 and I am very happy. Just a couple of things the rubber anti-slides on the bottom of the case are not attached very well and 1 of mine fell off.
"I love this portable gaming environment. As described by many other reviews, this unit is nearly flawless. Excellent picture quality with no field of angle problems. Screen matte finish nearly eliminates any light reflection. Audio quality and volume are excellent for the size. I only have one minor and one major complaint. The minor complaint is that there is barely room to fit all your mandatory accessories to include two controllers, two power supplies and supporting cables. There is no room for game software storage. Lastly, the major flaw for me. I guess more like an annoyance. Once the ""D"" rings are installed to attach the shoulder strap, they get in the way of the locking clasps preventing you from closing the unit. This will happen with or without the strap connected to the ""D"" rings but only occurs if the ring moves forward in the direction of the locking claps. It is a flaw but needs to be noted. Other than that, I would still buy it again and recommend it to everyone!! Plus, I caught it on sale for $299. Sold!"
Just received my GAEMS Halo UNSC from Amazon this weekend priced at $299.00 at the time.
"This product is sooo wonderful, you can play your Xbox and PS3 everywhere. High quality and worth every penny, i will buy another one for my young brother."
Free shipping and super fast shipping to an APO address.  It works like a charm over here and keeps everything together within the case.  It was a great price and worth it to any serviceman who is away from home.
"This seems to be a solid case for transporting an Xbox 360 or PS3.  I bought it for a PS3 for a trip and it seemed to hold up well.  The monitor is the largest you'll find for this purpose.  It may not be the best screen like your TV, but it is clear without being too grainy and isn't too small to make you squint all the time while your playing.  If your going on frequent trips or find that going to granny's house a lot or friends, or even school every day (college where you've got an hour or so between classes or whatever, or the same for high school) or it'd even be perfect for the dorm!  It's great in having the ability to take your favorite console with you."

"This thing is vivid, bright, and sounds amazing. Having a little LAN party at your buddy's? Pack up your system in one go. This thing is easy and amazing!"

"As a Halo addict, when I heard 343 and Gaems teamed up to make this I was on the pre-order list. The case is pretty durable for being plastic. The 19' screen is incredibly sharp and does not glare even in direct lighting from overhead. The sound is powerful for such a small box."
"At first, i heard about it in one of  a website news, i always wondered how good can a-screen-in-a-box would be when compared with real wide screen HD TV. i was pessimistic at first, specially about its picture quality and sound quality. And since I'll be continuing my education abroad on autumn this year, and i had experience of how boring living alone abroad when there is no game console nearby during my last overseas study in 2004. This product is a god-sent solution to my problem despite my initial pessimism."
